# Build the current version of a recipe, as specified by the file
# debian/changelog (and output by the Version: line of rapt-parsechangelog(1)).
# If the file recipe_version.orig.tar.{gz|bzip2|xz} is not present, an attempt
# will be made to acquire it using uscan(1). The build will take place in the
# directory recipe_version/. If this directory already exists, it will be
# removed. The directory packagaing/recipe/debian/ must exist; it will be
# copied to recipe_version/debian/ after creating recipe_version/.
