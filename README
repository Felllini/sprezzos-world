	After installing python-stdeb, run:
	 python setup.py --command-packages=stdeb.command bdist_deb
	Results will be in deb_dist following a successful build.

III. Package notes

cups -- will break in the presence of firewalling or port unavailability
eglibc -- have yet to successfully build due to unit test failure of
          unknown cause (eintr.c test)
libxml2 -- parallel builds appear to be broken.
