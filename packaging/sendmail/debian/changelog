  [ Tobias Hansen ]
  * Directories in /usr/share/doc can only be symlinks for packages
    depending on the package they link to. (Policy 12.5)
    This source package builds six sets of packages that can all be
    installed independently (libmilter1.0.1, rmail, sendmail-base,
    sendmail-cf, sendmail-doc, sensible-mda and respective dependencies).
    So using symlinks at all is not practicable.
    Make all /usr/share/doc/package directories real directories and
    ship mandatory files (they were already shipped in all packages).
    Put additional documentation into /usr/share/doc/sendmail-doc
    and libmilters README.Debian into /usr/share/doc/libmilter-dev.
    (Closes: #681147, #336391)

  * New upstream release

  * libmilter moves from 1 (1.0.0) to 1.0.1
    *** MILTER Packages should be to new scheme ASAP ***

    If you are upstream, or deal well with them, please note
    that patch-level updates (last digits) are not supposed to
    break the ABI - and milters should use the 1st two digits

    > Should not they be testing SM_LM_VRS_MAJOR(SMFI_VERSION) &
    > SM_LM_VRS_MINOR(SMFI_VERSION) - and thereby assuming that
    > simple patch-level updates don't break compatability ?

    Yes. That's the basic idea behind the numbering.  Hmm, I guess I
    should update the documentation and the example program.

sendmail (8.14.2-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Determine libmilter library level dynamically - using the upstream
    notation of <version-major>.<version-minor>.<patch-level>

    This way, I don't need to remember to bump .so levels by hand, as
    upstream is pretty good about incompatabilites - and the package
    name directly corresponds with what a milter developer/builder
    needs to know (instead of libmilter2 == 1.0.1) - though the sendmail
    version also gives that information.

    This does affect the milter packages, who currently link against
    libmilter1, as the new name is libmilter1.0.0 (the -dev package
    keeps is name; libmilter-dev).

    NOTE: things will continue work until milters are rebuilt - as
    the old library package still works.

    With this change, when 8.14.3 is shipped, it will automatically
    create libmilter1.0.1 (a bump in the patch level).

    I thought about adding a compat symlink, but the milters don't seem
    to be written in a way that makes that possible - they apparently are
    checking exact values of SMFI_VERSION, instead of
      SM_LM_VRS_MAJOR(SMFI_VERSION) & SM_LM_VRS_MINOR(SMFI_VERSION)
    and so don't work with the newer 1.0.1 level anyway (trust me) :(

  * Create an ELF "PT_GNU_RELRO" segment header in the object.
    Or in other words: built with "-z relro"

  * When generating an executable or shared library, mark it to tell
    the dynamic linker to resolve all symbols when the program is
    started, or when the shared library is linked to using dlopen,
    instead of deferring function call resolution to the point when
    the function is first called.
    Or in other words: built with "-z now"

  * Emit extra code to check for buffer overflows, such as stack
    smashing attacks. This is done by adding a guard variable to
    functions with vulnerable objects. This includes functions
    that call alloca, and functions with buffers larger than 8
    bytes. The guards are initialized when a function is entered
    and then checked when the function exits.  If a guard check
    fails, an error message is printed and the program exits.
    Or in other words: built with "-fstack-protector-all"

  * Compiled as PIE (Position Independant Executable)
    This assists PAX enabled kernels, with ASLR, and is also needed
    for GRSecurity.  Even with stock kernels, this makes the memory
    mapping less static, hindering attacks.
