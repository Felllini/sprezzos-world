sendmail (8.13.1-14) unstable; urgency=low

  * TLS errors:
   From http://lists.debian.org/debian-security/2003/09/msg00209.html
   > I cannot get STARTTLS to work with the newest sendmail in unstable.
   > It *always* complains that the key file is group readable!
   > Now, before you scream RTFM, I did use GroupReadableKeyFile!

   please copy "/usr/share/sendmail/examples/starttls.m4 to /etc/mail/tls and 
   execute 'sendmailconfig' after you copied the file over.

   It's an updated file you have to use by now. You should have read the
   install message by the sendmail update and the changelog too ;p

   You have to do the same with SASLv2 m4 if you use SASLv2

sendmail (8.13.1-8) unstable; urgency=low

  * Make initial install prompt free (by using a sane&safe default):
    + listen only to 127.0.0.1
    + if /etc/mailname extant, use it as the masquerade value
    + no smarthost (would have to prompt)
    + Issue msg to run sendmailconfig *later* if desired
    closes: #112397 #213022 #227464

    If the default setup isn't what you'd like, you can run sendmailconfig
    at any time to change your preferences...

  * Correct sasl2 instructions -                         closes: #265976   
    Here's what you must do to make sasl usable with smtp/smmsp:
    + chown smmta:smmsp /etc/sasldb2  (problematic if used by others)
    + dpkg-statoverride --remove /var/run/saslauthd
    + dpkg-statoverride --add root sasl 711 /var/run/saslauthd

    Now, anytime a user authenticates with a PLAIN password, SASL will
    add the password to /etc/sasldb2 (automigrate) and subsequently, the
    user may use more secure mechanisms.
