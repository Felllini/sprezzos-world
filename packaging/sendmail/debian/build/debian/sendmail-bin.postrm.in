# Debian post removal script
#
# Install of already installed package:
#	1) Upgrade of package:
#		new-preinst upgrade old-version
#		*) new-postrm abort-upgrade old-version
#	2) package had some configuration files from a previous version installed
#		new-preinst install old-version
#		*) new-postrm abort-install old-version
#	3) Otherwise (i.e., the package was completely purged)
#		new-preinst install
#		*) new-postrm abort-install
#
# Removal of a package:
#	1) prerm remove
#	2) The package's files are removed (except conffiles).
#	3) postrm remove
#	4) All the maintainer scripts except the postrm are removed.
#	5) The conffiles and any backup files
#		(~-files, #*# files, %-files, .dpkg-{old,new,tmp}, etc.) are removed.
#	6) postrm purge
#	7) The package's file list is removed
#
