ilmbase (1.0.1-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Use 3.0 (quilt) source format.

  * These two changes add support for build-arch target, fixing FTBFS.
    Closes: #666326

  * Use 'dpkg-buildflags --export=configure' to get hardening-flags.
    Add required b-d on dpkg-dev (>= 1.16.1). (Please note, that neither
    stackprotector nor fortify seem to have any effect, according to
    hardening-check.)

ilmbase (1.0.1-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * ACK previous NMUs, thanks to everyone involved.
  * Adopt the package within pkg-phototools (Closes: #494878):
     - Thanks to Adeodato Simó for having taken care of it until now!
     - Set Maintainer to the group.
     - Set Uploaders to myself.
     - Replace Vcs-Bzr with Vcs-{Git,Browser}.
  * Switch to debhelper 7:
     - Bump debian/compat to 7.
     - Version the B-D on debhelper: >= 7.0.50 to allow the use of
       overrides.
     - Simplify debian/rules.
     - Specify some targets: build and clean to handle updating/cleaning
       config.{guess,sub}, as well as patch/unpatch handling.
     - Specify some overrides:
        - dh_auto_configure: to set PTHREAD_LIBS=-lpthread when
          configuring, to ensure proper linking against libpthread.
        - dh_auto_test: to make sure not to run the testsuite on arm, or
          when DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS contains “nocheck”.
        - dh_installdocs: to install AUTHORS NEWS and README files in both
          packages without having to list those files in .docs files.
        - dh_makeshlibs: to pass -V to dh_makeshlibs.
  * As a consequence, no longer perform an out-of-tree build (see
    #480577). The clean target seems to do its job anyway.
  * Switch to using quilt:
     - Add a B-D on it.
     - Move the patch to fix the testsuite on m68k to a proper patch:
        + debian/patches/10_fix_testsuite_for_m68k
  * Add ${misc:Depends} to the Depends of both packages.
  * Bump Standards-Version from 3.7.3 to 3.8.1 (no changes needed).
  * Update copyright notices for the packaging.
