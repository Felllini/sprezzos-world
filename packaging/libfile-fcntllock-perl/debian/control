Description: Perl module for file locking with fcntl(2)
 File::FcntlLock is a Perl module to do file locking in an object oriented
 fashion using the fcntl(2) system call. This allows locks on parts of a file 
 as well as on the whole file and overcomes some known problems with flock(2), 
 on which Perl's flock() function is based.
 .
 Furthermore due to its design it supports reliable locking over NFS.
