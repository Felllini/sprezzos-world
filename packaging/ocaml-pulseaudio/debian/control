Description: OCaml interface to the PulseAudio sound server
 This package provied an interface to the PulseAudio sound server for 
 OCaml programmers.
 .
 PulseAudio, previously known as Polypaudio, is a sound server for POSIX and
 WIN32 systems. It is a drop in replacement for the ESD sound server with
 much better latency, mixing/re-sampling quality and overall architecture.
 .
 This package contains only the shared runtime stub libraries.
