girara (0.1.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Upload to unstable.
  * New upstream release.
  * debian/rules:
    - Set MSGFMTFLAGS=--endianness little. This makes
      debian/patches/msgfmt-endianness obsolete.
    - Set CK_DEFAULT_TIMEOUT=0 to disable check's timeout functionality. The
      tests may take longer than the default timeout of 4 seconds.
    - Upstream's build system now builds the mo pages in the default target so
      there is no need to call it manually anymore.
  * debian/patches:
    - Drop msgfmt-endianness: obsolete.
    - Drop separate-mo-files: not needed anymore as this is fixed upstream.
    - Drop fix-translation: not needed anymore.
  * debian/libgirara-symbols.common: Add new symbols.
