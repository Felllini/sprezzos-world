Description: C and C++ Code Counter, a software metrics tool
 CCCC analyses and reports measurements of source code in C, C++, and Java.
 It was developed to augment programmers' instinctive application of numeric
 rules of thumb about what constitutes high or low quality products with an
 automated analysis tool.
