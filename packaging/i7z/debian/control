Package: i7z-gui

Description: GUI for i7z, a reporting tool for i7, i5, i3 CPUs
 i7z reports Intel Core i7, i5, i3 CPU information about Turbo Boost,
 frequencies, multipliers, ... and comes top-like display showing per core the
 current frequency, temperature and times spent in the C0/C1/C3/C6/C7 states.
 .
 This package contains the QT gui for i7z.
 .
 Note: For sandybridge and ivybridge, it incorrectly adds C7 state values to
 the C0 state, so it does report things incorrectly; use the console version
 as its up to date.
