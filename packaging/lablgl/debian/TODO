lablgl for Debian
----------------------

  * Need to add the download site in copyright.
  * lablgl needs manpage. (mostly ocaml manpage, but with added -thread).
  * In truth, it would be better to split the package between :
    - the togl tcl/tk widget.
    - the OpenGL library.
    - the togl bindings.
    - the gtkglarea bindings.
    - examples and docs ?
  * Examples checker.ml, scene.ml and simple.ml are not working, don't know
    why (am using the non-DRI versions of Xfree 4's OpenGL).
