Description: Define PATH_MAX if undefined.
 PATH_MAX is not defined by the POSIX standard and, while linux has such a
 limitation, other systems, such as Hurd, have no such concept.
 Define it to 4096 on such systems to avoid a build failure.
 The original patch, by "Marc Dequ√®nes (Duck)" <duck@duckcorp.org>, was
 applied for 0.82, but a new use of PATH_MAX was added later.
