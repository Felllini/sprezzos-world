Description: library to read and control CD-ROM (development files)
 This package contains development files (headers and static library)
 for the libcdio library.
 .
 This library is to encapsulate CD-ROM reading and
 control. Applications wishing to be oblivious of the OS- and
 device-dependant properties of a CD-ROM can use this library.
 .
 Some support for disk image types like BIN/CUE and NRG is available,
 so applications that use this library also have the ability to read
 disc images as though they were CD's.

Architecture: any
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Description: sample applications based on the CDIO libraries
 This package contains a collection of small libcdio-based tools:
  * cd-drive      show CD-ROM drive characteristics
  * cd-info       show information about a CD or CD-image
  * cd-read       read information from a CD or CD-image
  * cdda-player   a simple curses-based audio CD player
  * iso-info      show information about an ISO 9660 image
  * iso-read      read portions of an ISO 9660 image
  * mmc-tool      issue low-level commands to a CD drive
