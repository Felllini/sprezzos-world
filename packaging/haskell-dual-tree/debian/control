Description: extrass for Reader and State Monoids
 This package provides a library for the Haskell programming language.

 This library provides Monoid extrass for the Reader Monoid and
 the State Monoid. There's no Monoid extras for the Writer Monoid
 since the Writer Monad transforms a Monoid into a Monad.
