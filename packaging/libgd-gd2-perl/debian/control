Description: Perl module wrapper for libgd - gd2 variant
 This is a autoloadable interface module for libgd, a popular library
 for creating and manipulating PNG files.  With this library you can
 create PNG images on the fly or modify existing files.  Features
 include:
 .
  * Lines, polygons, rectangles and arcs, both filled and unfilled
  * Flood fills
  * The use of arbitrary images as brushes and as tiled fill patterns
  * Line styling (dashed lines and the like)
  * Horizontal and vertical text rendering
  * Support for transparency and interlacing
  * Support for TrueType font rendering, via libfreetype.
  * Support for spline curves, via GD::Polyline
  * Support for symbolic font names, such as "helvetica:italic"
  * Support for symbolic color names, such as "green", via GD::Simple
  * Produces output in png, gif, jpeg and xbm format
  * Produces output in svg format via GD::SVG.
 .
 Included with the example code is the perl script qd.pl with QuickDraw
 routines for generating PICT2 files (used on Apple Macintosh).
 .
 This package is linked against libgd2, with Xpm (X pixmap)
 support.
