Description: System dedicated to the visualization of huge graphs
 Tulip is capable of managing graphs with up to 500,000 nodes and edges
 on relatively modest hardware (eg. 600MHz Pentium III, 256MB RAM).
 It includes the following features:
 .
  * 3D visualizations
  * 3D modifications
  * Plug-in support for easy evolution
  * Building of clusters and navigation into them
  * Automatic drawing of graphs
  * Automatic clustering of graphs
  * Automatic selection of elements
  * Automatic metric coloration of graphs
