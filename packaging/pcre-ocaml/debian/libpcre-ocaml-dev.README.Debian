  - About the examples

    Examples' Makefiles are built using OcamlMakefile and thus
    depend on it, to build them install the ocamlmakefile package
    that contains OcamlMakefile and change the OCAMLMAKEFILE
    variable defined in the various Makefiles making it point to
    /usr/share/ocamlmakefile/OCamlMakefile.

    E.g.  OCAMLMAKEFILE = /usr/share/ocamlmakefile/OCamlMakefile
