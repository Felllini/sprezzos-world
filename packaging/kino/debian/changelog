  * debian/control: Build-depend on libsamplerate0-dev and libdv4-dev.
    This kino version requires libdv 0.102 at least, so an alternative
    build-dep on libdv2-dev is not possible.
  * debian/control: Build-depend on libx11-dev, libxv-dev, libxext-dev,
    following the xlibs-dev split.
  * debian/control: Build-dep on version of libquicktime-dev linked with
    libdv4.
  * debian/control: Add hotplug to Suggests (for jogshuttle support).
  * debian/kino.menu: Quote all strings to shut up lintian.
  * debian/rules: Override hotplug script and usermap dir. Rename usermap
    file to kino.usermap.
  * debian/rules: Override libquicktime shlibs info to make kino depend on
    a version that links with libdv4.

    packages.
  * README.Debian: Update plugin part to refer to Debian packages.

kino (0.70-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version (aka 0.7.0).

    + [10_include_cassert] Rediffed.
    + [20_endian_types] Rediffed.
  * Removed patches:
    + [30_videodev_include]
      Obsolete, bug was fixed in linux-kernel-headers package.

  * debian/control: Bump standards version.

kino (0.65-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version (aka 0.6.5).
  * Applied patches:
    + [10_include_cassert] Old, converted to dpatch.
      Include <cassert> where appropriate to keep g++ 3.3 happy.
    + [20_endian_types] Old, converted to dpatch.
      Ensure correct AVI on-disk format on big-endian an 64-bit archs.
    + [30_videodev_include] New.
      Compile with local, modified copy of v4l1 header because v4l2
      breaks with current glibc. v4l2 is not used in kino anyway.
      Closes: #221058
  * Removed patches:
    + [20_encapsulate_gnome_gettext]
      (Aka the safe_gnome hack.) gnome.h still sucks, but kino upstream
      has re-enabled gettext support as a workaround.
  * debian/rules: Convert to dpatch.
  * debian/control: Build-depend on dpatch.
  * debian/control: Add mjpegtools to Suggests to make people who don't
    read README.Debian read README.Debian when they find out that there
    is no official mjpegtools package. Closes: #218621
  * debian/README.Debian: Document some mjpegtools quirks. Upload
    plugin information.

kino (0.64-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * src/Makefile.{am,in}: Install safe_gnome.h in /usr/include/kino. Some
    kino headers reference it. Closes: #202270

 -- Daniel Kobras <kobras@debian.org>  Mon, 21 Jul 2003 21:43:52 +0200

kino (0.64-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * src/{avi,filehandler,page_export_1394,riff}.cc: Include <cassert>.
    Adapted from dvgrab patch by Kevin Kreamer.
  * src/safe_gnome.h, src/Makefile.am, src/Makefile.in: New header
    safe_gnome.h that prevents gnome.h from messing with gettext defines.
  * src/*: Include safe_gnome.h instead of gnome.h.
  * All of the above fix build errors with g++ 3.3. Closes: #197757

 -- Daniel Kobras <kobras@debian.org>  Thu, 19 Jun 2003 19:01:06 +0200

kino (0.64-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * src/Makefile.{am,in}, src/endian_types.h: New class providing basic types
    in little-endian storage.
  * src/{avi,riff}.{h,cc}: Fix AVI on-disk format on big-endian and 64bit
    archs.

    method.

 -- Daniel Kobras <kobras@debian.org>  Tue, 15 Apr 2003 10:18:27 +0200

kino (0.64-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version (aka 0.6.4, you know the story). Closes: #180200
  * debian/control: Build dep on libquicktime. Tighten versions
    on libdv and libavc1394 build deps. Explicitly build depend on
    libglib.
  * debian/control: gnome-help is no more. Remove from suggests.
  * debian/control: Bump standards version.
  * debian/rules: Use debhelper compat level 4.

  * debian/rules: Do not install Makefiles in pixmaps dir.

 -- Daniel Kobras <kobras@debian.org>  Wed,  2 Apr 2003 17:31:38 +0200

kino (0.60.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version. (NB: Again, upstream calls this version 0.6,
    and the tarball is labelled as 0.6-1. It is my firm belief that me
    slightly tweaking the version causes less confusion than an epoch
    hell.)
  * debian/README.Debian: Updated notes on third-party plugins.
  * debian/rules: No longer need to clean up after upstream install
    target.

 -- Daniel Kobras <kobras@debian.org>  Sat, 26 Oct 2002 21:43:58 +0200

kino (0.51-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.
  * Raise libdv build dep.
  * Do not provide video1394.* any longer. Recent enough versions have
    been in the kernel for ages.
  * fx.html doc file missing in release--add from upstream CVS.
  * Suggest sox and vorbis-tools for audio export.
  * Some export filters use packages not yet in Debian. Added download
    hints to README.Debian.
  * Install some headers in /usr/include/kino, so external plugins can
    be built against this package. (Provide kino-dev? Humm..., not yet.)
  * Document some potential plugin pitfalls in README.Debian.

 -- Daniel Kobras <kobras@debian.org>  Thu,  8 Aug 2002 15:30:23 +0200

kino (0.50-3) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Adapt to libdv 0.9.5. Adjust build-deps accordingly.
  * Added Arch line back to any. kino is really useful even without
    IEEE 1394 hardware.
  * Include libgtkxmhtml-dev and libzvt-dev to build deps.

 -- Daniel Kobras <kobras@debian.org>  Sun, 21 Apr 2002 17:31:41 +0200

kino (0.50-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Do not pass whole DV frames via the stack, keep alpha happy.
    Closes: #123164 

 -- Daniel Kobras <kobras@debian.org>  Tue, 11 Dec 2001 16:52:09 +0100

kino (0.50-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version. (NB: Upstream calls this version 0.5 in some
    places and 0.50 in others. Chose 0.50 to avoid an epoch.)
  * Suggest gnome-help--we have online docs now.
  * Mozilla doesn't like local filenames. Expand location of help files
    to full URLs.
  * Add menu entry to Apps/Graphics.
  * Build depends on libxml2-dev now.

 -- Daniel Kobras <kobras@debian.org>  Mon, 19 Nov 2001 15:18:07 +0100

kino (0.46-1) unstable; urgency=low

kino (0.45-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version. Closes: #112148
  * Man page was merged upstream. Removed Debian-specific version.
  * Backup config.{guess,sub} before clobbering with uptodate version.
    Restore on clean.
  * Patch from upstream CVS: remove extraneous comma in video1394.c.
  * Patch from upstream CVS: fix corruption when recording with audio
    enabled.

 -- Daniel Kobras <kobras@debian.org>  Tue, 18 Sep 2001 14:23:39 +0200

kino (0.43-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * [This is basically upstream 0.44, but as the upstream tarball is
     screwed, I rather distribute the (few) changes as a Debian patch
     against sane upstream 0.43.]
  * Fix PAL playback when using XV display.
  * Include upstream BUGS file that wasn't distributed in 0.43.
  * Added ludicrous architectures line to keep m68k maintainer happy.
    (Took out s390 and hurd-i386 as well. This solution is ugly as hell,
    but there's no better alternative right now.)

 -- Daniel Kobras <kobras@debian.org>  Thu, 21 Jun 2001 17:14:11 +0200

kino (0.43-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Initial release. Closes: #89512
