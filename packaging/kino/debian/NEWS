kino (0.70-1) unstable; urgency=low

  With this release, kino has switched to a new major version of its
  underlying graphics libraries, Gnome2 and Gtk2. The change affects
  any kino plugins that you might have installed: You need to download
  new versions of all plugins suitable for kino 0.70, and rebuild.
  As a consequence, the name of kino's plugin directory was also
  changed; plugins now need to be installed into /usr/lib/kino-gtk2/.
