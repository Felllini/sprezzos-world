Description: OCaml image processing library (Runtime library)
 CamlImages is an image processing library for OCaml, which provides:
 .
  * basic functions for image processing and loading/saving
    various image file formats (hence providing a translation
    facility from format to format)
 .
  * an interface with the Caml graphics library allows one to display
    images in the Graphics module screen and to mix them with Caml
    drawings
 .
  * a freetype interface, integrated into the library: you can
    draw texts into images using any truetype fonts
 .
 In addition, the library can handle huge images that cannot be
 (or can hardly be) stored into the main memory (the library then
 automatically creates swap files and escapes them to reduce the
 memory usage).
 .
 This package contains only the shared runtime stub libraries.
