Description: fast, expressive, and context-driven unit-testing framework for Ruby
 Riot is a fast, expressive, and context-driven unit-testing framework for the
 Ruby programming language.
 .
 In contrast to other popular Ruby testing frameworks such as Test::Unit,
 Shoulda and RSpec, Riot does not run a setup and teardown sequence before and
 after each test. In Riot, tests separated in "contexts" in which a "topic"
 object is defined, and assertions on this object are made.
