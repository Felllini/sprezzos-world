Description: SubBand Codec for A2DP Bluetooth
 The Bluetooth Special Interest Group (SIG) specified the low-complexity,
 subband codec (SBC) in the Advanced Audio Distribution Profile (A2DP).
 SBC is an audio encoder and decoder to connect Bluetooth high quality
 audio devices like headphones or loudspeakers.
 .
 It uses 4 or 8 subbands, an adaptive bit allocation algorithm in
 combination with an adaptive block PCM quantizers. Frans de Bont has
 based the SBC audio codec on his earlier work, and – in parts – on
 the MPEG-1 Audio Layer II standard. In addition, the SBC is based on
 the algorithms described in the EP-0400755B1. The patent owners wrote
 that they allow the free usage of SBC in Bluetooth application, with
 the view to boost the use of this technology. All applications outside
 Bluetooth are however not free. The patent expired June 2, 2010.
