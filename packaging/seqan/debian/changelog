seqan (1.3.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version
  * debian/watch: Adapt to new way to provide release archives
  * debian/orig-tar.sh:
     - Be less noisy
     - Provide fallback target dir in case .svn/deb-layout doese not
       exist - which is the case at least in my checkout
  * debian/control:
     - Standards-Version: 3.9.3 (no changes needed)
     - distinct short descriptions
  * debian/seqan-dev.doc-base: Provide doc-base control file
  * debian/rules + several debhelper files:
    Rely more on debhelper than manual moving around files to make
    debian/rules better maintaineable
  * debian/rules:
     - Do not specify single target files but rather use find to
       obtain files to move around
     - Save a copy of those files which will be removed by upstream
       clean target otherwise to enable building twice in a row

seqan (1.3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Team upload.
  * New upstream release (Closes: #640302).

  [ Charles Plessy ]
  * Collected various informations in ‘debian/upstream-metadata.yaml’.
  * Compress the source and binary packages with xz
    (debian/orig-tar.sh, debian/rules).
  * Removed convenience code copy of samtools (debian/orig-tar.sh).
  * Use Debhelper 8 (debian/compat, debian/control).
  * Conforms to Policy 3.9.2 (debian/control, no other changes needed).
  * Built using the cmake class of CDBS (debian/rules).
  * debian/control:
    - Corrected VCS URLs.
    - Build-Depend on libboost-dev as Cmake was looking for it.
    - Build-Depend on zlib1g-dev, as seqan needs to detect zlib to set
      SEQAN_HAS_SAMTOOLS to 1.
    - Changed Priority from extra to optional.
    - Changed sequan-apps Section from libdevel to science.
  * debian/patch/samtools.patch corrects path to SAMtools headers.
  * Machine-readable debian/copyright.

  [ Andreas Tille ]
  * debian/control
    - added myself to uploaders
    - Standards-Version: 3.9.1 (no changes needed)
  * debian/watch: Also catch RC candidates
  * debian/source/format: 3.0 (quilt)
