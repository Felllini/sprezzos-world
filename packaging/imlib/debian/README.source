This is a dpkg source v3.0 quilt style package with a quirky
build directory hack via debian/rules.

The "builddir" target creates a working directory, debian/build/,
and copies the source code there. debian/build/debian/ is a symlink
to the top debian/ directory.

The "clean" target will delete debian/build/.
