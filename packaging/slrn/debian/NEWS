  GNU TLS support is back. Since this version you can use encrypted
  connections.

slrn (0.9.9~pre102-3) unstable; urgency=low

  I've found a way to make slrn and slrnpull read /etc/news/server. So,
  this file is since this version supported.

slrn (0.9.9~pre77-1) experimental; urgency=low

  John E. Davis, the inventor of slrn, has taken over upstream development
  again. He has stripped down the source to bring UTF-8 integration forward.
  In this version, UTF-8 should be fully supported.

  Unfortunately he has removed support for GNU TLS. As Debian does not have
  permission to link slrn against SSL, this package does not provide any
  support for encryption. Stay tuned: this may well come back soon.

  He has also temporarily dropped support for slrnpull. I've built the package
  but you should expect everything to be broken.

  The support of /etc/news/server was dropped, too. This will be fixed in
  the future, but until then you must use the option -h or set the
  environment variable NNTPSERVER, i.e. create an alias in your shell:

    alias slrn='NNTPSERVER="$(cat /etc/news/server)" slrn'
