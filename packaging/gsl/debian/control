Description: GNU Scientific Library (GSL) -- library package 
 The GNU Scientific Library (GSL) is a collection of routines for
 numerical analysis.  The routines are written from scratch by the GSL
 team in C, and present a modern API for C programmers, while allowing 
 wrappers to be written for very high level languages.
 .
 GSL includes data types and routines for complex numbers, vectors,
 matrices, basic linear algebra subroutines (BLAS), eigensystems,
 simulated annealing, minimization, root finding, pseudo-random
 numbers, least-squares fitting, fast Fourier transforms (FFT),
 differential equations, quadrature, Monte Carlo integration, special
 functions, physical constants, and much more.
 .
 This package provides the shared libraries required to run programs
 compiled with GNU GSL. To compile your own programs you also need to
 install libgsl0-dev.

Description: GNU Scientific Library (GSL) -- development package
 The GNU Scientific Library (GSL) is a collection of routines for
 numerical analysis.  The routines are written from scratch by the GSL
 team in C, and present a modern API for C programmers, while allowing
 wrappers to be written for very high level languages.
 .
 This package contains the header files, static libraries and symbolic 
 links that developers using GNU GSL will need.

Description: GNU Scientific Library (GSL) -- binary package
 The GNU Scientific Library (GSL) is a collection of routines for
 numerical analysis.  The routines are written from scratch by the GSL
 team in C, and present a modern API for C programmers, while allowing 
 wrappers to be written for very high level languages.
 .
 This package provides several example binaries.

Description: GNU Scientific Library (GSL) -- debug symbols package
 The GNU Scientific Library (GSL) is a collection of routines for
 numerical analysis.  The routines are written from scratch by the GSL
 team in C, and present a modern API for C programmers, while allowing
 wrappers to be written for very high level languages.
 .
 This package contains debugging symbol tables for the static  GSL libraries
 libgsl and libgslcblas from the libgsl0-dev package, and the binaries 
 gsl-randist and gsl-histogram from the gsl-bin package.

Description: GNU Scientific Library (GSL) -- Profiling Libraries
 The GNU Scientific Library (GSL) is a collection of routines for
 numerical analysis.  The routines are written from scratch by the GSL
 team in C, and present a modern API for C programmers, while allowing
 wrappers to be written for very high level languages.
 .
 This package contains static libraries compiled with profiling info (-pg)
 suitable for use with gprof.
