Description: GNU plotutils command line tools based on libplot
 The GNU plotting utilities include programs for plotting
 two-dimensional scientific data.  They are built on top of GNU
 `libplot', a library for device-independent two-dimensional vector
 graphics.

Description: GNU plotutils libraries
 The GNU plotting utilities include programs for plotting
 two-dimensional scientific data.  They are built on top of GNU
 `libplot', a library for device-independent two-dimensional vector
 graphics.
 .
 This package contains the shared libraries used by the programmes in
 plotutils to alleviate the need for packages to depend on the entire
 plotutils package.

Description: GNU plotutils libraries (development files)
 The GNU plotting utilities include programs for plotting
 two-dimensional scientific data.  They are built on top of GNU
 `libplot', a library for device-independent two-dimensional vector
 graphics.
 .
 This package contains the header files and static libraries necessary
 for building programs which use libplot.
