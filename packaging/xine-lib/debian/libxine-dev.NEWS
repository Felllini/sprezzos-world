xine-lib (1.1.20.1-2) unstable; urgency=low

  The dependencies on libxine1-x and libxine1-console have been REMOVED.

  Packages which require video output are expected to depend on one or both
  of these according to whether they require X or console support.

  If you maintain one, then you need to have it depend on ${xine-x:Depends}
  or ${xine-console:Depends}, else it may be unuseable on installation. For
  these variables to work, you need to run 'dh_xine x' or 'dh_xine console'
  prior to dh_gencontrol. (You can hard-code, but the names of these two
  packages will change with the soname.)

  ***

  As of 1.1.20.1-3, it is expected that libxine-dev will be removed.

  Package maintainers will need to check that their packages are buildable
  with libxine-dev in experimental or libxine2-dev in unstable.
  (At the time of writing, libxine2-dev is as yet unavailable.)
