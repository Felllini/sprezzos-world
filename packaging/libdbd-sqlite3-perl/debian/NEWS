libdbd-sqlite3-perl (1.37-1) unstable; urgency=low

  From upstream changes:

    *** CHANGES THAT MAY POSSIBLY BREAK YOUR OLD APPLICATIONS ***
    - Updated to SQLite 3.7.10 (ISHIGAKI)
      Note that this release changed the default schema format
      number, that means newly created database files will be
      unreadable by SQLite version prior to 3.3.0 (2006-01-10)
      (or DBD::SQLite prior to 1.12) unless you explicitly issue
      "PRAGMA legacy_file_format=ON".

libdbd-sqlite3-perl (1.35-1) unstable; urgency=low

  From upstream changes:  

    *** CHANGES THAT MAY POSSIBLY BREAK YOUR OLD APPLICATIONS ***
    - Resolved #67581: bind_param SQL_INTEGER numifies value;
      Now DBD::SQLite croaks if you explicitly specify datatype
      (with bind_param) and datatype mismatch happens (ISHIGAKI)
    - Datatype set in the bind_param(_array) becomes sticky now
      (as per DBI spec). This potentially affects code depending on
      current undocumented and broken behavior. (Yuriy Kaminskiy)

libdbd-sqlite3-perl (1.27-1) unstable; urgency=low

  The following changes may break older applications:

  * Development releases (never uploaded to Debian) saw some changes
    with foreign key support. Foreign key support was enabled by
    default but broke a lot of things, so is now disabled once again.
    Please note that support may be enabled upstream in sqlite itself
    so things that break should be fixed.

    In the meantime, you can enable foreign keys with:
      PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON
  * Remove undocumented reset method (use $sth->finish instead)
  * Fix $dbh->column_info to work according to the DBI spec (RT#49716)
  * Fix $sth->primary_key_info to work according to DBI spec
