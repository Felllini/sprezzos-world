* El Samuko GIMP Scripts:
  * Antique Photo Border Script:
    This script simulates a yellowed and slightly jagged border
    like these of old photographies.
  * Che Guevara Script:
    This script generates a poster like the famous Che Guevara
    one from Jim Fitzpatrick.
  * Cyanotype Script:
    This script simulates the Cyanotype printing process.
  * Difference Layer Script
    This script generates two difference layers from the two layers
    on the top. It's similar to GIMP's built-in Grain Extract/Merge
    function, but the tonal range is bigger.
    Now you can apply further editing and "switch on/off" the
    adjustment by switching the visibility of the subtractive and
    the additive layer.
    Also you can change the modification intensity by changing the
    intensity of these two layers.
  * Erosion Sharpen:
    Sharpens the image with erosion and dilation.
  * Escape Line Script:
    This script creates escaping lines from any point. It's similar
    in function to the built-in Line-Nova Script, but much more
    flexible. So you can chose the center, the thickness, the angle,
    the length, the offset and the randomness.

    This is yet another script which simulates the typical film grain
    of high ISO pictures.
