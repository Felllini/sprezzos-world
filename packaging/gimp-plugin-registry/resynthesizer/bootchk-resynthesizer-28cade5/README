This package is a set of plugins for use with the Gimp program.
The package includes:

- resynthesizer plugin engine (without a GUI)
- resynthesizer-gui plugin control panel for the engine
- various plugins (in Python language) that call the resynthesizer engine

Version
=======

Version 1.0 derives from version 0.16 maintained by the original author.

See the NEWS file.

Installing
==========

These are instructions for most users who received a pre-built distribution (with resynthesizer.exe and resynthesizer-gui.exe already compiled).

1.  Remove any older versions (see below.)

2.  Copy all files to your home gimp directory for plugins:

~/.gimp-2.6/plug-ins (Linux)
c:\Doc...Settings\username\gimp-2.6\plug-ins (Windows)


Removing older versions
=======================

You should manually remove these older versions before installing this package.  They probably do NOT still work, and are duplicates at best.

They might be found in the usual places:

Linux

~/.gimp-2.x/plug-ins (.exe and .py)
~/.gimp-2.x/scripts  (.scm)
/usr/share/gimp/2.0/scripts (.scm)
/usr/local/lib/gimp/2.0/plugins (.exe and .py)

Windows

c:\Program Files\GIMP-2.0\lib\gimp\2.0\plug-ins (.exe and .py)
c:\Program Files\GIMP-2.0\share\gimp\2.0\plug-ins (.scm)
c:\Doc...Settings\username\gimp-2.6\plug-ins  (.exe and .py)
c:\Doc...Settings\username\gimp-2.6\scripts  (.scm)


Dependencies
============

This discusses dependencies within the package (a concern of users, not of a builder.) Resynthesizer.exe is the base plugin.  All other plugins only depend on it as the engine.  All other plugins are optional.  Resynthesizer-gui.exe is the control panel for the engine, offering the "Map>Resynthesize" menu item.  Without it, all other plugins will still work.


Building on Linux
=================

It builds with GNU build tools.  Many of the build files (Makefile.am, configure.in, etc.) were hacked from the gimp-plugin-template 2.2.0.

To build and install a clean distribution, just ...

  ./autogen.sh
	./configure
	make
	make install

It installs to the shared Gimp directories.

Note the default gcc flags seem to be: -g -O2 -Wall.
To optimize more, pass the CFLAGS (perogative of the builder to alter compilation):

make CFLAGS=-O3


Building on other platforms
===========================

(On the darkside OS, who hijacked a common word for fenestration)

I use MinGW and MSYS.
(Use mingw-get to download gnu build tools perl, automake etc.)
However it doesn't install plugins properly.
You will need to copy files to the proper Gimp plugin install directory,
typically from:

c:\MSYS\1.0\usr\local\lib\gimp\2.0\plug-ins
to:
c:\Doc...Settings\yourname\.gimp-2.6\plug-ins
