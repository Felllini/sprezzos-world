This plug-in simulates a streak camera.

A streak camera images an object through a slit - thus getting a
"one dimensional image". This image is propagated along the
second dimension of the image plane at a constant speed.
The result is a picture of the time dependency of the object.

The plug-in takes a film (multilayer image), cuts a slice of
selectable width and position out of each layer and puts the
slices together to the streak image.

Please see http://www.macgeisler.de/gimp/the_gimp.html#streak
for an example on how to use streak.
