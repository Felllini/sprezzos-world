* Refocus {version}:
  The GIMP plugin to refocus images using FIR Wiener filtering.
  During image processing operations such as scanning and scaling, images
  tend to get blurry. The blurred impression of these images is due to the
  fact that image pixels are averaged with their neighbors. Blurred images
  don't have sharp boundaries and look as though they have been taken with
  an unfocused camera.
