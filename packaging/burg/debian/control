Description: New bootloader based on GRUB
 BURG is a brand-new boot loader based on GRUB. It uses a new object format
 which allows it to be built in a wider range of OS, including
 Linux/Windows/OSX/Solaris/FreeBSD, etc. It also has a highly configurable menu
 system which works in both text and graphic mode.
