Description: Portable sound library - binaries
 This binary is capable of playing samples as well as module
 files and was originally written by Jean-Paul Mikkers (MikMak) for DOS. It has
 subsequently been hacked by many hands and now runs on many Unix flavours.
 It uses the OSS /dev/dsp driver included in all recent kernels for output,
 and will also write wav files.
 .
 Supported file formats include mod, stm, s3m, mtm, xm, and it.
