License: CC-BY-SA
 THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE
 COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE ("CCPL" OR "LICENSE"). THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY
 COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS
 AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS PROHIBITED.
 .
 BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO BE
 BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS
 CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS.
 .
 1. Definitions
 .
 "Collective Work" means a work, such as a periodical issue, anthology or
 encyclopedia, in which the Work in its entirety in unmodified form, along with
 a number of other contributions, constituting separate and independent works in
 themselves, are assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a
 Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work (as defined below) for
 the purposes of this License.
 .
 "Derivative Work" means a work based upon the Work or upon the Work and other
 pre-existing works, such as a translation, musical arrangement, dramatization,
 fictionalization, motion picture version, sound recording, art reproduction,
 abridgment, condensation, or any other form in which the Work may be recast,
 transformed, or adapted, except that a work that constitutes a Collective Work
 will not be considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this License. For
 the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical composition or sound
 recording, the synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a moving
 image ("synching") will be considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this
 License.
 .
 "Licensor" means the individual or entity that offers the Work under the terms
 of this License.
 .
 "Original Author" means the individual or entity who created the Work.
 .
 "Work" means the copyrightable work of authorship offered under the terms of
 this License.
 .
 "You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this License who
 has not previously violated the terms of this License with respect to the Work,
 or who has received express permission from the Licensor to exercise rights
 under this License despite a previous violation.
 .
 "License Elements" means the following high-level license attributes as
 selected by Licensor and indicated in the title of this License: Attribution,
 ShareAlike.
 .
 2. Fair Use Rights. Nothing in this license is intended to reduce, limit, or
 restrict any rights arising from fair use, first sale or other limitations on
 the exclusive rights of the copyright owner under copyright law or other
 applicable laws.
 .
 3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor
 hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the
 duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in the
 Work as stated below:
 .
 to reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more Collective
 Works, and to reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collective Works;
 .
 to create and reproduce Derivative Works;
 .
 to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform publicly,
 and perform publicly by means of a digital audio transmission the Work
 including as incorporated in Collective Works;
 .
 to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform publicly,
 and perform publicly by means of a digital audio transmission Derivative Works.
 .
 For the avoidance of doubt, where the work is a musical composition:
 Performance Royalties Under Blanket Licenses. Licensor waives the exclusive
 right to collect, whether individually or via a performance rights society
 (e.g. ASCAP, BMI, SESAC), royalties for the public performance or public
 digital performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work.
 .
 Mechanical Rights and Statutory Royalties. Licensor waives the exclusive right
 to collect, whether individually or via a music rights society or designated
 agent (e.g. Harry Fox Agency), royalties for any phonorecord You create from
 the Work ("cover version") and distribute, subject to the compulsory license
 created by 17 USC Section 115 of the US Copyright Act (or the equivalent in
 other jurisdictions).
 .
 Webcasting Rights and Statutory Royalties. For the avoidance of doubt, where
 the Work is a sound recording, Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect,
 whether individually or via a performance-rights society (e.g. SoundExchange),
 royalties for the public digital performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work,
 subject to the compulsory license created by 17 USC Section 114 of the US
 Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other jurisdictions).
 .
 The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or
 hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such
 modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other
 media and formats. All rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby
 reserved.
 .
 4. Restrictions.The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made
 subject to and limited by the following restrictions:
 .
 You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally
 perform the Work only under the terms of this License, and You must include a
 copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for, this License with every copy
 or phonorecord of the Work You distribute, publicly display, publicly perform,
 or publicly digitally perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the
 Work that alter or restrict the terms of this License or the recipients'
 exercise of the rights granted hereunder. You may not sublicense the Work. You
 must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer
 of warranties. You may not distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or
 publicly digitally perform the Work with any technological measures that
 control access or use of the Work in a manner inconsistent with the terms of
 this License Agreement. The above applies to the Work as incorporated in a
 Collective Work, but this does not require the Collective Work apart from the
 Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a
 Collective Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent
 practicable, remove from the Collective Work any credit as required by clause
 4(c), as requested. If You create a Derivative Work, upon notice from any
 Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Derivative Work
 any credit as required by clause 4(c), as requested.
 .
 You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally
 perform a Derivative Work only under the terms of this License, a later version
 of this License with the same License Elements as this License, or a Creative
 Commons iCommons license that contains the same License Elements as this
 License (e.g. Attribution-ShareAlike 2.5 Japan). You must include a copy of,
 or the Uniform Resource Identifier for, this License or other license specified
 in the previous sentence with every copy or phonorecord of each Derivative Work
 You distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally
 perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Derivative Works that
 alter or restrict the terms of this License or the recipients' exercise of the
 rights granted hereunder, and You must keep intact all notices that refer to
 this License and to the disclaimer of warranties. You may not distribute,
 publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the
 Derivative Work with any technological measures that control access or use of
 the Work in a manner inconsistent with the terms of this License Agreement.
 The above applies to the Derivative Work as incorporated in a Collective Work,
 but this does not require the Collective Work apart from the Derivative Work
 itself to be made subject to the terms of this License.
 .
 If you distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally
 perform the Work or any Derivative Works or Collective Works, You must keep
 intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium
 or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym,
 if applicable) if supplied, and/or (ii) if the Original Author and/or Licensor
 designate another party or parties (e.g. a sponsor institute, publishing
 entity, journal) for attribution in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of
 service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; the
 title of the Work if supplied; to the extent reasonably practicable, the
 Uniform Resource Identifier, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated
 with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or
 licensing information for the Work; and in the case of a Derivative Work, a
 credit identifying the use of the Work in the Derivative Work (e.g., "French
 translation of the Work by Original Author," or "Screenplay based on original
 Work by Original Author"). Such credit may be implemented in any reasonable
 manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Derivative Work or Collective
 Work, at a minimum such credit will appear where any other comparable
 authorship credit appears and in a manner at least as prominent as such other
 comparable authorship credit.
 .
 5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer
 .
 UNLESS OTHERWISE AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK
 AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE
 MATERIALS, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT
 LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
 PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY,
 OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME
 JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH
 EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
 .
 6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN
 NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL,
 INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS
 LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
 POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
 .
 7. Termination
 .
 This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon
 any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities who
 have received Derivative Works or Collective Works from You under this License,
 however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or
 entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7,
 and 8 will survive any termination of this License.
 .
 Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is
 perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work).
 Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work
 under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time;
 .
 provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this
 License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted
 under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full force
 and effect unless terminated as stated above.
 .
 8. Miscellaneous
 .
 Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform the Work or a Collective
 Work, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same
 terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
 .
 Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform a Derivative Work,
 Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same
 terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
 .
 If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable
 law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the
 terms of this License, and without further action by the parties to this
 agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to
 make such provision valid and enforceable.
 .
 No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach
 consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by
 the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.  This License constitutes
 the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Work licensed
 here. There are no understandings, agreements or representations with respect
 to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional
 provisions that may appear in any communication from You. This License may not
 be modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.
 .
 Creative Commons is not a party to this License, and makes no warranty
 whatsoever in connection with the Work. Creative Commons will not be liable to
 You or any party on any legal theory for any damages whatsoever, including
 without limitation any general, special, incidental or consequential damages
 arising in connection to this license. Notwithstanding the foregoing two (2)
 sentences, if Creative Commons has expressly identified itself as the Licensor
 hereunder, it shall have all rights and obligations of Licensor.
 .
 Except for the limited purpose of indicating to the public that the Work is
 licensed under the CCPL, neither party will use the trademark
 "Creative Commons" or any related trademark or logo of Creative Commons without
 the prior written consent of Creative Commons. Any permitted use will be in
 compliance with Creative Commons' then-current trademark usage guidelines, as
