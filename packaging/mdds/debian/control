Description: Multi Dimension Data structure library -- headers
 A collection of multi-dimensional data structure and indexing algorithm.
 .
 This is a C++ library, and is a collection of various data structures designed
 to efficiently store and query multi-dimensional data for various
 filtering criteria. Different structures are optimized for different
 query needs.
 .
 This library is a source-code only library. Itâ€™s designed to be
 header-only meaning that the user program does not need to link to any
 additional shared library in order to use these data structures. The
 data structures are all available as C++ templates.
