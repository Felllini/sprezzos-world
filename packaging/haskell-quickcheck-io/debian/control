Description: Haskell automatic IO testing library for GHC
 This package provides a library for the Haskell programming language.
 .
 quickcheck-io is a library for testing Haskell programs automatically.
 The programmer provides a specification of the program, in
 the form of properties which functions should satisfy, and
 quickcheck-io then tests that the properties hold in a large number
 of randomly generated cases.  Specifications are expressed in
 Haskell, using combinators defined in the quickcheck-io library.
 quickcheck-io provides combinators to define properties, observe
 the distribution of test data, and define test data generators.
