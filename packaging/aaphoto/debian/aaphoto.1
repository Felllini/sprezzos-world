.SH NAME
aaphoto - automatic color correction of photos

.SH SYNOPSYS
aaphoto [option[s]] [source file[s]]

.SH DESCRIPTION
Auto Adjust Photo is a tiny command-line image manipulation tool
for automatic color correction of photos. It tries to make the picture
look better. The program does this by analyzing the input image and then
sets the most optimal contrast, gamma, color balance and saturation for it.
.br

The following image types are supported (thanks to JasPer, JPEG and PNG):
.br
mif, pnm / pgm / ppm, bmp, ras, jp2, jpc, jpg, png
.br
.PP
Quality settings can be applied only to jp2, jpc, jpg formats
