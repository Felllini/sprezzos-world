liblrdf (0.4.0-3) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Stop relaxing build rules only required in DEB_MAINTAINER_MODE, and
    related relaxing/suppression of build-dependencies: We rely on
    copyright-check rule for putting aside upstream autobuilt files
    during build, so always need a new CDBS.
  * Tighten build-dependency on cdbs to be versioned.
  * Build-depend on devscripts and dh-buildinfo.
  * Set urgency=medium as above affects only packaging hints and the
    prior 0.4.0-2 release was kept from entering testing due to a too
    old version of cdbs on hppa buildd.

liblrdf (0.4.0-2) unstable; urgency=low

    file.
  * Enable CDBS semi-automated control file updating.
  * Enable CDBS copyright check (weak-included to ease backporting).
  * Enable CDBS get-orig-source handling.
  * Enable CDBS autoreconf. Revert source-applied autoreconf.
  * Use dpkg source format "3.0 (quilt)".
  * Add proper licensing header to debian/rules.
  * Rewrite copyright file conforming to draft DEP5 rev. 135.
  * Add Homepage stanza to control file.
  * Update URL to upstream source.
  * Rewrite watch file. Closes: bug#449752, thanks to Raphael Geissert.
  * Relax build-dependency on libraptor1-dev to be unversioned (needed
    version satisfied in oldstable).
  * Bump debhelper compat level to 6 (new enough to be modern, while
    still ease backporting. Tighten build-dependency accordingly.
  * Install files and resolve development dependencies using d-shlibs.
  * Use ${binary:Version} (not ${Source-Version}), and relax library
    package suggestion on development header package to be unversioned.
  * Set section in source section, thanks to lintian.
  * Use ${misc:Depends}.
  * Bump Standards-Version to 3.8.4.
  * Isolate patch 1001 disabling libtool -version-info.
  * Isolate patch 1002 renaming clashing md5 symbols.

liblrdf (0.4.0-1.2) unstable; urgency=high

  * Non-maintainer upload.
  * src/lrdf_md5.h: Fix symbol conflicts with other MD5 implementations.
    Exporting symbols like md5_init() is not a good idea. This fixes
    the crashes when initializing the GStreamer when the LADSPA plugin
    is installed (which should be the case in all installations).
    Essentially this made pidgin, empathy, totem and a lot of other
    applications unusable (Closes: #521898).

liblrdf (0.3.7-3) unstable; urgency=medium

  * debian/watch: added
  * otherwise simply rebuild because arm and sparc buildds failed on 0.3.7-1
    due to a broken libraptor-dev and didn't bother to requeue during 60 days
    neither reacted to pings about the issue.
    Urgency medium to hurry into testing after 60 days of waiting.
