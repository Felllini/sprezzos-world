ptlib on Debian
===============

ptlib-config is not distributed, as pkg-config is now used.

DC and AVC plugins are not distributed anymore, since they do not
compile anymore with current version of libraw1394 and libdc1394 and
libavc1394 debian dependency packages.

For any help or comments, please contact Debian VoIP Team at
<pgk-voip-maintainers@lists.alioth.debian.org>
