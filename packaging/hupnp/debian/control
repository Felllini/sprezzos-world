Description: Basic web service support - SOAP protocol
 The Qt SOAP project provides basic web service support with
 version 1.1 of the SOAP protocol.
 .
 This is a partial implementation of SOAP v1.1.
 .
 - Server side SOAP is not supported. - References to values (id &
 href attributes) are not supported. - Only arrays with less than 5
 dimensions are supported. - Namespaces for types are not checked.
 Only the type names are used. - The encodingStyle attribute is
 ignored. The serialization and encoding rules from section 5 in
 the SOAP v1.1 specification are assumed regardless of the value of
 the encodingStyle attribute. - QtSoapType does not have accessors
 for attributes, which means for example that actor, mustUnderstand
 and so on are not accessible in headers. - The SOAP root attribute
 is not supported.
