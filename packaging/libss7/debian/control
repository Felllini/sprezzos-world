Description: Signalling System 7 (ss7) development files
 A userspace library that provids SS7 protocol services to applications.
 It has a working MTP2, MTP3, and ISUP for ITU and ANSI style SS7, however
 it was written in a manner that will easily allow support for other various
 national specific variants in the future.  For a working reference
 implementation, see the various link test programs, as well as the Asterisk
