Description: ncurses-based client for the Music Player Daemon (MPD)
 ncmpcpp is almost an exact clone of ncmpc which is a text-mode client
 for MPD, the Music Player Daemon. It provides a keyboard oriented and
 consistent interface to MPD and contains some new features ncmpc
 doesn't have. It's been also rewritten from scratch in C++.
 .
 New features include:
  - tag editor;
  - playlists editor;
  - easy to use search screen;
  - media library screen;
  - lyrics screen;
  - possibility of going to any position in currently playing track
    without rewinding/fastforwarding;
  - multi colored main window (if you want);
  - songs can be added to playlist more than once;
  - a lot of minor useful functions.
