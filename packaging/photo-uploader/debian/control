Description: Command line photo uploader
 Photo uploader is a command line utility (and Python module) for
 uploading photos to minilabs for printing or to any service for image
 hosting. It currently supports only a few minilab services in Czechia 
 and some hosting services like ImageShack, but can be easily extended 
 to support others.
