.SH NAME
clmake \- color wrapper for make(1) and less(1)
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBclmake\fR [ \fB-f makefile\fR ] [ option ] ...  target ...
.SH DESCRIPTION
clmake acts as a wrapper around make(1) to ease reading the output by
colorizing it. It also pipes the output to the \fBless\fR(1) text
pager.
.SH OPTIONS
clmake uses the same command line options as \fBmake\fR(1).
.SH USAGE
To change a makefile to use clmake, you may change the path at the top which
normally reads \fB#!/usr/bin/make\fR to \fB#!/usr/bin/clmake\fR.
.PP
Alternately, you may type \fBclmake\fR whenever you would normally type
\fBmake\fR when compiling programs.
