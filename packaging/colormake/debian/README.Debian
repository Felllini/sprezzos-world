As of version 0.2-3.1 of the package, the binary has been renamed from
colormake.pl to colormake. This respect the convention which states
that binaries should not have names depending on the interpreter they
use.

Thus, the command name will not change is, some day, the interpreter
is changed.

The transition is handled by an alternative.
