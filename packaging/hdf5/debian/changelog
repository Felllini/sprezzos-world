  * Skip the inclusion of C++ when dealing with parallel HDF5
    Thanks to Mike Miller, Rafael Laboissiere & Sebastien Villemot

  * Non-maintainer upload.

hdf5 (1.8.8-7) unstable; urgency=low

  * Now shlibs suggest both parallel or serial version to avoid problems
    with rdepends that could use both serial or parallel version to build and
    are 'parallel agnostic'.
    (closes: #657949, #658281, #658307)
  * Now hdf5-tools depends strictly on the provided library in the source.
    Using a virtual is quite pointless, being hdf5-tools provided by the
    same source package.

    previous mess.

 -- Francesco Paolo Lovergine <frankie@debian.org>  Mon, 25 Jan 2010 17:37:39 +0100

hdf5 (1.8.4-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Current library still retains the 1.8 SONAME and that causes problems 
    in upgrading. Unfortunately HDF5 library has a long history of API/ABI violations
    among "minor" revisions. So introducing one more virtual package to provide/conflict
    and also coflicting against last 1.8.3 package for managing a safe upgrade.
    See README.source for more information.
    (closes: #566540, #566339, #566533, #566738, #566698)

    (closes: #515579)

 -- Francesco Paolo Lovergine <frankie@debian.org>  Thu, 06 Aug 2009 16:40:50 +0200

hdf5 (1.8.3-1) experimental; urgency=low

hdf5 (1.6.7-1) unreleased; urgency=low

  * New upstream release. This is a bug fix release, but for removing of the
    virtual stream I/O library, which is now stripped out of the main library.
    I know Cactus uses that I/O driver, but it is not packaged.
  * Manually run "autoupdate; libtoolize --force --copy; aclocal; autoheader;
    autoconf" in the base directory, and "autoupdate; libtoolize --force
    --copy; aclocal; autoconf" in the c++/ directory.

  * Homepage field updated in debian/control.in.
    (closes: #501564)

    (closes: #470159)
  * Dropped -0 suffix in all run-time libraries packages.
  * Changed SONAMEs and solib names as consequence. Dependencies will require
    rebuilding in order to use the new libraries. Now SONAMEs uses an
    ordinary serialization which depends on the upstream versions.
    Incidentally the new SONAMEs and library names do not conflict with 
    the old ones.
  * Now using quilt to manage patches.
