Description: ICAP server implementation
 C-ICAP is an implementation of an ICAP server. It can be used with 
 HTTP proxies that support the ICAP protocol to implement content 
 adaptation and filtering services.
 .  
 Most of the commercial HTTP proxies must support the ICAP protocol. 
 The open source Squid 3.x proxy server supports it. 
 .
 This Package contains the core ICAP daemon
