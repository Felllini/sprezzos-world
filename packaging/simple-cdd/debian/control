Description: create custom debian-installer CDs
 simple-cdd is a limited though relatively easy tool to create a customized
 debian-installer CD. 
 .
 it includes simple mechanisms to create "profiles" that define common system
 configurations, which can be selected during system installation. simple-cdd
 also makes it easy to build CDs with language and country settings
 pre-configured.
 .
 this can be used to create a crude "Custom Debian Distribution" using packages
 from Debian, with pre-configuration of packages that use debconf.  custom
 configuration scripts can be specified to handle packages that don't support
 debconf pre-configuration.
 .
 testing CD images with qemu is also made simple with a provided script.
