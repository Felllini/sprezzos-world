      infringed by Covered Code in the absence of Modifications made by
      that Contributor.
 .
 3. Distribution Obligations.
 .
 3.1. Application of License.
 The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are
 governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation
 Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be
 distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version
 of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a
 copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You
 distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code
 version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this
 License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may include
 an additional document offering the additional rights described in
 Section 3.5.
 .
 3.2. Availability of Source Code.
 Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be
 made available in Source Code form under the terms of this License
 either on the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted
 Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an
 Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic
 Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12)
 months after the date it initially became available, or at least six
 (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification
 has been made available to such recipients. You are responsible for
 ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if the
 Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.
 .
 3.3. Description of Modifications.
 You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain a
 file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and
 the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that
 the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original
 Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the
 Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an
 Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the
 origin or ownership of the Covered Code.
 .
 3.4. Intellectual Property Matters
      (a) Third Party Claims.
      If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party's
      intellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights
      granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2,
      Contributor must include a text file with the Source Code
      distribution titled "LEGAL" which describes the claim and the
      party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will
      know whom to contact. If Contributor obtains such knowledge after
      the Modification is made available as described in Section 3.2,
      Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies
      Contributor makes available thereafter and shall take other steps
      (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups)
      reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Covered
      Code that new knowledge has been obtained.
 .
      (b) Contributor APIs.
      If Contributor's Modifications include an application programming
      interface and Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses which
      are reasonably necessary to implement that API, Contributor must
      also include this information in the LEGAL file.
 .
           (c)    Representations.
      Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to
      Section 3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor's
      Modifications are Contributor's original creation(s) and/or
      Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by
      this License.
 .
 3.5. Required Notices.
 You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source
 Code.  If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source
 Code file due to its structure, then You must include such notice in a
 location (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely
 to look for such a notice.  If You created one or more Modification(s)
 You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in
 Exhibit A.  You must also duplicate this License in any documentation
 for the Source Code where You describe recipients' rights or ownership
 rights relating to Covered Code.  You may choose to offer, and to
 charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability
 obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You
 may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial
 Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than
 any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is
 offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial
 Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the
 Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty,
 support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.
 .
 3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.
 You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the
 requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code,
 and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of
 the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License,
 including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the
 obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included
 in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or
 collateral in which You describe recipients' rights relating to the
 Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered
 Code or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may
 contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in
 compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the
 Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's
 rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this
 License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different
 license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ
 from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial
 Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the
 Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by
 the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such
 terms You offer.
 .
 3.7. Larger Works.
 You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code
 not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger
 Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the
 requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.
 .
 4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.
 .
 If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
 License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to
 statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with
 the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)
 describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description
 must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must
 be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the
 extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be
 sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to
 understand it.
 .
 5. Application of this License.
 .
 This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has
 attached the notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.
 .
 6. Versions of the License.
 .
 6.1. New Versions.
 Netscape Communications Corporation ("Netscape") may publish revised
 and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each version
 will be given a distinguishing version number.
 .
 6.2. Effect of New Versions.
 Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the
 License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that
 version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms
 of any subsequent version of the License published by Netscape. No one
 other than Netscape has the right to modify the terms applicable to
 Covered Code created under this License.
 .
 6.3. Derivative Works.
 If You create or use a modified version of this License (which you may
 only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code
 governed by this License), You must (a) rename Your license so that
 the phrases "Mozilla", "MOZILLAPL", "MOZPL", "Netscape",
 "MPL", "NPL" or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear in your
 license (except to note that your license differs from this License)
 and (b) otherwise make it clear that Your version of the license
 contains terms which differ from the Mozilla Public License and
 Netscape Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial
 Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in
 Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of
 this License.)
 .
 7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.
 .
 COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS" BASIS,
 WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,
 WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF
 DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING.
 THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE
 IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT,
 YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE
 COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER
 OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF
 ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.
 .
 8. TERMINATION.
 .
 8.1.  This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
 automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure
 such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All
 sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall
 survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their
 nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License
 shall survive.
 .
 8.2.  If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement
 claim (excluding declatory judgment actions) against Initial Developer
 or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom
 You file such action is referred to as "Participant")  alleging that:
 .
 (a)  such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly
 infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such
 Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License
 shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively,
 unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i)
 agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable
 royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications made by such
 Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to
 the Contributor Version against such Participant.  If within 60 days
 of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not
 mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim
 is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under
 Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of
 the 60 day notice period specified above.
 .
 (b)  any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant's
 Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then
 any rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b)
 and 2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the date You first made, used,
 sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that
 Participant.
 .
 8.3.  If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant
 alleging that such Participant's Contributor Version directly or
 indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as
 by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent
 infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses
 granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken
 into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or
 license.
 .
 8.4.  In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above,
 all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers)
 which have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder
 prior to termination shall survive termination.
 .
 9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.
 .
 UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT
 (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL
 DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE,
 OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR
 ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY
 CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL,
 WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER
 COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN
 INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF
 LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY
 RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW
 PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE
 EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO
 THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
 .
 10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.
 .
 The Covered Code is a "commercial item," as that term is defined in
 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial computer
 software" and "commercial computer software documentation," as such
 terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48
 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995),
 all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those
 rights set forth herein.
 .
 11. MISCELLANEOUS.
 .
 This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject
 matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
 unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
 necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by
 California law provisions (except to the extent applicable law, if
 any, provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law provisions.
 With respect to disputes in which at least one party is a citizen of,
 or an entity chartered or registered to do business in the United
 States of America, any litigation relating to this License shall be
 subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern
 District of California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County,
 California, with the losing party responsible for costs, including
 without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and
 expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on
 Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded.
 Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract
 shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this
 License.
 .
 12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.
 .
 As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is
 responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly,
 out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to
 work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such
 responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or
 shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.
 .
 13. MULTIPLE-LICENSED CODE.
 .
 Initial Developer may designate portions of the Covered Code as
 "Multiple-Licensed".  "Multiple-Licensed" means that the Initial
 Developer permits you to utilize portions of the Covered Code under
 Your choice of the NPL or the alternative licenses, if any, specified
 by the Initial Developer in the file described in Exhibit A.

 A. HISTORY OF THE SOFTWARE
 ==========================
 .
 Python was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting
 Mathematisch Centrum (CWI) in the Netherlands as a successor of a
 language called ABC.  Guido is Python's principal author, although it
 includes many contributions from others.  The last version released
 from CWI was Python 1.2.  In 1995, Guido continued his work on Python
 at the Corporation for National Research Initiatives (CNRI) in Reston,
 Virginia where he released several versions of the software.  Python
 1.6 was the last of the versions released by CNRI.  In 2000, Guido and
 the Python core development team moved to BeOpen.com to form the
 BeOpen PythonLabs team.  Python 2.0 was the first and only release
 from BeOpen.com.
 .
 Following the release of Python 1.6, and after Guido van Rossum left
 CNRI to work with commercial software developers, it became clear that
 the ability to use Python with software available under the GNU Public
 License (GPL) was very desirable.  CNRI and the Free Software
 Foundation (FSF) interacted to develop enabling wording changes to the
 Python license.  Python 1.6.1 is essentially the same as Python 1.6,
 with a few minor bug fixes, and with a different license that enables
 later versions to be GPL-compatible.  Python 2.1 is a derivative work
 of Python 1.6.1, as well as of Python 2.0.
 .
 After Python 2.0 was released by BeOpen.com, Guido van Rossum and the
 other PythonLabs developers joined Digital Creations.  All
 intellectual property added from this point on, starting with Python
 2.1 and its alpha and beta releases, is owned by the Python Software
 Foundation (PSF), a non-profit modeled after the Apache Software
 Foundation.  See http://www.python.org/psf/ for more information about
 the PSF.
 .
 Thanks to the many outside volunteers who have worked under Guido's
 direction to make these releases possible.

 1. Definitions
 .
    1. "Collective Work" means a work, such as a periodical issue, anthology or encyclopedia, in which the Work in its entirety in unmodified form, along with a number of other contributions, constituting separate and independent works in themselves, are assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work (as defined below) for the purposes of this License.
    2. "Derivative Work" means a work based upon the Work or upon the Work and other pre-existing works, such as a translation, musical arrangement, dramatization, fictionalization, motion picture version, sound recording, art reproduction, abridgment, condensation, or any other form in which the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted, except that a work that constitutes a Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical composition or sound recording, the synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a moving image ("synching") will be considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this License.
    3. "Licensor" means the individual or entity that offers the Work under the terms of this License.
    4. "Original Author" means the individual or entity who created the Work.
    5. "Work" means the copyrightable work of authorship offered under the terms of this License.
    6. "You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this License who has not previously violated the terms of this License with respect to the Work, or who has received express permission from the Licensor to exercise rights under this License despite a previous violation.
    7. "License Elements" means the following high-level license attributes as selected by Licensor and indicated in the title of this License: Attribution, ShareAlike.
 .
 2. Fair Use Rights. Nothing in this license is intended to reduce, limit, or restrict any rights arising from fair use, first sale or other limitations on the exclusive rights of the copyright owner under copyright law or other applicable laws.
 .
 3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:
 .
    1. to reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more Collective Works, and to reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collective Works;
    2. to create and reproduce Derivative Works;
    3. to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform publicly, and perform publicly by means of a digital audio transmission the Work including as incorporated in Collective Works;
    4. to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform publicly, and perform publicly by means of a digital audio transmission Derivative Works.
    5.
 .
       For the avoidance of doubt, where the work is a musical composition:
          1. Performance Royalties Under Blanket Licenses. Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a performance rights society (e.g. ASCAP, BMI, SESAC), royalties for the public performance or public digital performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work.
          2. Mechanical Rights and Statutory Royalties. Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a music rights society or designated agent (e.g. Harry Fox Agency), royalties for any phonorecord You create from the Work ("cover version") and distribute, subject to the compulsory license created by 17 USC Section 115 of the US Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other jurisdictions).
    6. Webcasting Rights and Statutory Royalties. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a sound recording, Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a performance-rights society (e.g. SoundExchange), royalties for the public digital performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work, subject to the compulsory license created by 17 USC Section 114 of the US Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other jurisdictions).
 .
 The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats. All rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.
 .
 4. Restrictions.The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:
 .
    1. You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work only under the terms of this License, and You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for, this License with every copy or phonorecord of the Work You distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that alter or restrict the terms of this License or the recipients' exercise of the rights granted hereunder. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties. You may not distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work with any technological measures that control access or use of the Work in a manner inconsistent with the terms of this License Agreement. The above applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collective Work, but this does not require the Collective Work apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collective Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collective Work any credit as required by clause 4(c), as requested. If You create a Derivative Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Derivative Work any credit as required by clause 4(c), as requested.
    2. You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform a Derivative Work only under the terms of this License, a later version of this License with the same License Elements as this License, or a Creative Commons iCommons license that contains the same License Elements as this License (e.g. Attribution-ShareAlike 2.5 Japan). You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for, this License or other license specified in the previous sentence with every copy or phonorecord of each Derivative Work You distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Derivative Works that alter or restrict the terms of this License or the recipients' exercise of the rights granted hereunder, and You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties. You may not distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Derivative Work with any technological measures that control access or use of the Work in a manner inconsistent with the terms of this License Agreement. The above applies to the Derivative Work as incorporated in a Collective Work, but this does not require the Collective Work apart from the Derivative Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License.
    3. If you distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work or any Derivative Works or Collective Works, You must keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or (ii) if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g. a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; the title of the Work if supplied; to the extent reasonably practicable, the Uniform Resource Identifier, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and in the case of a Derivative Work, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Derivative Work (e.g., "French translation of the Work by Original Author," or "Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author"). Such credit may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Derivative Work or Collective Work, at a minimum such credit will appear where any other comparable authorship credit appears and in a manner at least as prominent as such other comparable authorship credit.

 5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer
 .
 UNLESS OTHERWISE AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE MATERIALS, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
 .
 6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
 .
 7. Termination
 .
    1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have received Derivative Works or Collective Works from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.
    2. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.
 .
 8. Miscellaneous
 .
    1. Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform the Work or a Collective Work, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
    2. Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform a Derivative Work, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
    3. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
    4. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.
    5. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.
