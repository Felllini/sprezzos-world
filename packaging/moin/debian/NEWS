moin (1.9.0~) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release, requiring content migration.

    + Semi-automated migration:

      Add your MoinMoin wiki(s) to /etc/moin/wikilist, and invoke
      moin-mass-migrate as root

      (future packaging routines might automate use of that wikilist)

    + Manual migration:

      See /usr/share/doc/python-moinmoin/README.migration(.gz).

    Depending on your local setup, you may also need to adjust your
    apache config to use new path to static content.

moin (1.6.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * FCKeditor removed from Debian installation!
    The graphical editor, FCKeditor, is disabled with Debian, due to
    security concerns: The version of FCKeditor included with MoinMoin
    is older than the one maintained separately for Debian, and due to
    security issues with the software in the past it has been judged too
    risky to maintain multiple copies of the software with the
    distribution.
    The editor is provided as example files, so you can manually
    reinstate it again if you understand and acknowledge the security
    implications of doing so.
