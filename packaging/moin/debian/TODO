TODO list for moin:

  * Package and suggest TWikiDrawPlugin
    Building: "ant -Dbuild.compiler=gcj"
  * Update and extend danish l12n of system pages.
  * Pass on the following wishlist upstream:
    + Support in Include() macro for plain grepping (in addition to
      "before" and "after" stripping) - needed to include e.g. only list
      items
    + Macro listing "members of (MembersGroup and (FriendsGroup or
      MePersonally/FriendsGroup) except EvilGroup".
  * Avoid optimizing .py files below /usr/share/moin (requires update to
    CDBS)
  * Package non-english underlay pages as Debian packages.
  * Consider packaging the flup WSGI server supported from 1.5 and up:
    http://www.saddi.com/software/flup/
  * Move global dict dir below /etc/moin (new to Debian-packaged
    MoinMoin: we used to patch source to always use local dict dirs).
  * Strip scripts/ subdir from library packages (provide them only as
    examples: they require manual editing to be of any use).
  * Rename config dir below examples to default_config.
  * Move /htdocs/common/ie7/README.txt out to docs dir.
  * Improved use of interwiki.txt:
    * Install below /etc/moin/ (not below /usr/share/moin/ ).
    * Include a copy below ...examples/default_config/ .
    * Convert to Unix-style line-ends.
    * Strip wiki comments at top of the file.
  * Hack default farmconfig.py to use initerwiki.txt
  * Install moin.cgi below /usr/share/cgi-bin
  * Request upstream to properly license CSS files and PNG logo icons.
  * Request the authors of PNG images to properly license PNG icons:
    + Esselbach Storyteller CMS at http://www.esselbach.com/
    + Leo Doerr @ www.silverpoint.com
    + (track down origin of remaining icons)
  * Request the author of FCKEditor to properly license files below
    wiki/htdocs/applets/moinFCKplugins currently licensed as unversioned
    LGPL.
  * Suggest upstream to include referenced external license files:
    + MoinMoin/support/htmlmarkup.py
    + MoinMoin/support/xapwrap/index.py
