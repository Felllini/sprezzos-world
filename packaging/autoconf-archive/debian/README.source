[gitpkg]
This is controlled by a file debian/source/git-patches. Each line contains a range suitable for passing to git-format-patch(1). 
The variables UPSTREAM_VERSION and DEB_VERSION are replaced with values taken from debian/changelog. 
Note that $UPSTREAM_VERSION is the first part of $DEB_VERSION
An example is:
 upstream/$UPSTREAM_VERSION..patches/$DEB_VERSION
 upstream/$UPSTREAM_VERSION..embedded-libs/$DEB_VERSION

This tells gitpkg to export the given two ranges of commits to debian/patches while generating the source package. 
Each commit becomes a patch in debian/patches, with names generated from the commit messages. In this example, we get 5 patches from the two ranges.
 0001-expand-pattern-in-no-java-rule.patch
 0002-fix-dd_free_global_constants.patch
 0003-Backported-patch-for-CPlusPlus-name-mangling-guesser.patch
 0004-Use-system-copy-of-nauty-in-apps-graph.patch
 0005-Comment-out-jreality-installation.patch

Thanks to the wonders of 3.0 (quilt) packages, these are applied when the source package is unpacked.

This package uses quilt to manage all modifications to the upstream
source.  Changes are stored in the source package as diffs in
debian/patches and applied during the build.

Moreinformation: man gitpkg
