gtk-theme-switch (2.0.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream (me) release. Becomes Debian native.
  * These patches are new, but were merged into the new native source:
    - 05_use_2.0_in_mine.dpatch: use file name '.gtkrc-2.0.mine' when writing
      canned .gtkrc-2.0 for personal changes to avoid conflict with
      .gtkrc.mine.
    - 06_check_gtkrc_NULL.dpatch: check to see whether gtkrc is NULL, or else
      feof() and fclose() will choke on it. Thanks Zack Cerza.
  * Quote stuff in debian/menu.

  * 03_path_search.dpatch: don't use if (access(bleh)) to see if an error
    was returned, use if (access(bleh) == -1), to avoid false positives.
    Also fix a memory leak with g_strconcat for both switch and switch2.
  * Bump to Standards-Version 3.6.1.0.
  * Menu title is really useless, make it a bit nicer.
  * Fix copyright file to include a Copyright <years> <authors> and the GPL
    short blurb instead of just 'GPLv2', per Peter Palfrader's recommendation.

gtk-theme-switch (2.0.0rc2+1.0.1-3) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Recommend gtk-engines-pixmap - required for many themes downloaded
    outside of Debian. (Closes: #204964)
  * Add a README.Debian.
  * Change the switch2 symlink to gtk-theme-switch2, since most people
    will want to see both in the autocompletion of 'gtk-theme-switch.'
    Complain if this is undesirable.

  * Replace manpage with a nicer and more descriptive one which includes
    a description of switch2, made by myself.
