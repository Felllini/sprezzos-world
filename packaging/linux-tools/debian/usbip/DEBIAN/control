Description: USB device sharing system over IP network
 USB/IP is a system for sharing USB devices over the network.
 .
 To share USB devices between computers with their full functionality,
 USB/IP encapsulates "USB requests" into IP packets and transmits them
 between computers.
 .
 Original USB device drivers and applications can be used for remote USB
 devices without any modification of them.  A computer can use remote USB
 devices as if they were directly attached.
 .
 Currently USB/IP provides no access control or encryption.  It should only
 be used in trusted environments.
 .
 This package provides the server component 'usbipd' and the client tool
 'usbip'.
