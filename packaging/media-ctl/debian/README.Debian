Upstream has split the media-ctl package into the media-ctl binary and
two libraries, libmediactl and libv4l2subdev. Currently, this package
has this change reverted and builds everything together as media-ctl
since there are some open questions and bugs with the libraries at the
moment.

If you do use and need the libraries for your own programs, please file
a wishlist bug against this package requesting that the libraries be
split out again.
