Description: Configure Video4Linux media pipelines
 Some of the more complex Video4Linux devices use the media controller
 interface to expose their internal building blocks, which can then be
 connected to form a custom processing pipeline for video input and
 output.
 .
 media-ctl is a tool that allows you to examine and configure media
 controller connections from the command line or a shell script.
