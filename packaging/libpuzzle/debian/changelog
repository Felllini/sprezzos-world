libpuzzle (0.9-4) unstable; urgency=high

  * Fix missing dependency on phpapi-* for libpuzzle-php, thanks to
    Raphael Geissert (Closes: #566289):
     - Add ${php:Depends} to its Depends.
     - Use $(php-config5 --phpapi) to define this variable in the
       associated substvars file.
  * Set urgency to “high” accordingly.

libpuzzle (0.9-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix comment in debian/libpuzzle.ini as requested by Thijs Kinkhorst
    since the previous style generates warnings with PHP 5.3: Replace
    leading “#” with “;”, which is said to work with all current PHP
    versions.
  * Add ${misc:Depends} to libpuzzle-dev.

libpuzzle (0.9-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Pass “LDFLAGS=""” to the PHP extension's ./configure script. Since
    dpkg-buildpackage now exports LDFLAGS, an FTBFS is triggered because
    of “-Wl,-z,defs” (which was previously only used for the shared
    library, as intended); and since “-Wl,--as-needed” isn't sufficient to
    get rid of extra linking for that extension anyway, passing an empty
    LDFLAGS variable for that part of the build (Closes: #475984).
  * Move the maintainership to pkg-phototools as originally planned
    (thanks to to Emmanuel Bouthenot who proposed that package):
     - Set Maintainer to pkg-phototools.
     - Set Uploaders to myself, and update the mail address.
     - Add Vcs-Browser and Vcs-Git.
