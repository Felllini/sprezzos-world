TODO for libpuzzle:
-------------------

  * Check what happens when running “make check” on the php extension.
  * See whether it is possible to avoid the manual installation of the
    library so that the PHP extension finds it, based on Makefile target
    dependencies. At the moment, it seems not possible to use something
    like the following, because the install/* ones are triggering
    dh_testroot calls:
      build/foo:: install/bar
  * Find out whether it is possible to avoid libtool's reordering its
    arguments (the patch in #347650 isn't sufficient) so as to be able
    to pass “-Wl,-z,defs” and “-Wl,--as-needed” through LDFLAGS.
