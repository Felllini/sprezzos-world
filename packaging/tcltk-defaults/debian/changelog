tcltk-defaults (8.5.0-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Upload of 8.5 to unstable (closes: #515984).
  * Changed symlink targets for /usr/lib/tclConfig.sh and /usr/lib/tkConfig.sh
    to /usr/lib/tcl8.5/tclConfig.sh and /usr/lib/tk8.5/tkConfig.sh because
    the latter files are architecture dependent.
  * Added ${misc:Depends} to the binary packages dependency lists because
    the package is built using debhelper.
  * Bumped standards version to 3.9.1. No changes.
