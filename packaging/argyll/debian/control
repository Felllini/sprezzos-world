Description: Color Management System, calibrator and profiler
 Argyll is an experimental, open source, ICC compatible color management
 system. It supports accurate ICC profile creation for scanners, CMYK
 printers, film recorders and calibration and profiling of displays.
 Spectral sample data is supported, allowing a selection of illuminants
 observer types, and paper fluorescent whitener additive compensation.
 Profiles can also incorporate source specific gamut mappings for perceptual
 and saturation intents. Gamut mapping and profile linking uses the CIECAM02
 appearance model, a unique gamut mapping algorithm, and a wide selection of
 rendering intents. It also includes code for the fastest portable 8 bit
 raster color conversion engine available anywhere, as well as support for
 fast, fully accurate 16 bit conversion. Device color gamuts can also be
 viewed and compared using a VRML viewer.

Description: ICC profile I/O library
 The icclib is a set of routines which implement the reading and  
 writing of color profile files that conform to the International 
 Color Consortium (ICC) Profile Format Specification, Version 3.4.
 .
 This package contains two utilities :
 .
  * iccdump : dump an ICC file in human readable form.
  * icclu : translate colors through an ICC profile.
