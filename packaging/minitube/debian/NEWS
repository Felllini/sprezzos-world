minitube (1.8-1) unstable; urgency=low

  Starting with 1.8-1, minitube no longer depends on a particular phonon
  backend, and can thus no longer directly depend on all codec-related
  packages.

  Users of the GStreamer backend might want to

  * apt-get install gstreamer0.10-plugins-good gstreamer0.10-x

  and maybe

  * apt-get install gstreamer0.10-ffmpeg gstreamer0.10-plugins-bad

  as well.

  The VLC backend seems to pull in all necessary dependencies by itself.
