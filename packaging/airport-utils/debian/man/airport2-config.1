.SH NAME
airport2-config \- Configurator for the Apple AirPort Extreme Base
Station ("Snow")
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B airport2-config

.SH DESCRIPTION

\fBairport2-config\fP allows you to manage your AirPort base station,
just like the AirPort software on Mac OS X.

.SH OPTIONS

\fBairport2-config\fP accepts no command-line
options. \fBairport2-config\fP is a wrapper script around the
\fIAirport2BaseStationConfigurator.jar\fP jar file located in
\fI/usr/share/java/airport-utils\fP.

You can set the \fBJAVACMD\fP environment variable to use a specific JVM
instead of the one chosen by the wrapper script. Set the \fBDEBUG\fP
environment variable to 1 to get the debug output from the wrapper
script.

.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

.TP
.B DEBUG
Set this variable to 1 to get the debug output from the wrapper
script.

.TP
.B JAVACMD
The full path to the Java Virtual Machine to use. By default, the
wrapper uses \fBJAVACMD\fP; if it is not set, it looks for
\fBJAVA_BINDIR\fP/java, then for \fBJAVA_HOME\fP/bin/java before
looking for a java executable in the \fBPATH\fP. In the latter case,
the JVM used can be configured using the Debian alternatives system
(see \fBupdate-alternatives\fP(8)).

.TP
.B JAVA_HOME
The full path where your JDK/JRE is installed.

.TP
.B JAVA_BINDIR
The full path to the directory where the java executable is located.

.TP
.B JAVA_ARGS
Extra command-line arguments to be passed to the Java Virtual Machine.
