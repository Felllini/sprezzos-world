Description: CSS parser and optimiser
 csstidy parses and optimises your CSS code, making it cleaner and more
 concise.  The end result is a smaller CSS file and better written code. It
 has a variety of option settings giving the user a significant amount of
 control over the level of file compression and readability. It is not meant
 to be a css validator.
