snowdrop (0.02b-9) unstable; urgency=low

  * QA upload.
  * Push debhelper compatibility to v8
  * Convert package to 3.0 (quilt) format
  * Move man page to debian/ (thus, leave upstream source directory untouched)
  * Track changes to upstream source in a quilt patch (use-tls.patch)
  * Link as needed (-Wl,--as-needed, in link-as-needed.patch)
  * Push Standards to the most recent version 3.9.2
  * Fix "Very minor typo in manpage" fix several typos (Closes: #608868)

    obsolete since GnuTLS 2.7.12.1
  * Provide future uploaders a hint in `debian/README.Debian-source' to learn
    about changes in the upstream tarball, as the original file is not ver-
    sioned

  * Updated to libgnutls11. Closes: #264736

snowdrop (0.0.20020909-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * First release.
  * Fake version number as there is none upstream.
