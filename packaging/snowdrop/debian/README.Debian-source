snowdrop (0.02b-9) unstable; urgency=low

  As upstream development stopped long ago, there is no versioned source
  tarball available. You can download the most recent source nonetheless
  from [1]. This version is, to date, equivalent to Debian's version 0.02b.
  The SHA-1 checksum of snowdrop_0.02b.orig.tar.gz (being equivalent to [1])
  is:

  ac1fc5e83b5d56c5b63898f98ea9f9a7969da8b5 snowdrop_0.02b.orig.tar.gz

  Compare with the above checksum to find out, if upstream eventually updated
  the original tarball.
