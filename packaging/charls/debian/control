Description: Implementation of the JPEG-LS standard
 CharLS is an optimized implementation of the JPEG-LS standard for lossless and
 near-lossless image compression
 .
 JPEG-LS (ISO-14495-1/ITU-T.87) is a standard derived from the Hewlett Packard
 LOCO algorithm. JPEG LS has low complexity (meaning fast compression) and high
 compression ratios, similar to JPEG 2000. JPEG-LS is more similar to the old
 Lossless JPEG than to JPEG 2000, but interestingly the two different techniques
 result in vastly different performance characteristics.
