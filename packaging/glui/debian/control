Description: GLUI, a C++ GLUT based GUI library - Runtime support
 GLUI provides controls such as buttons, checkboxes, radio buttons, and
 spinners to OpenGL applications.  It is window-system independent, relying
 on GLUT to handle all system-dependent issues, such as window and mouse
 management. Features of the GLUI User Interface Library include:
 .
  - Complete integration with GLUT toolkit
  - Simple creation of a new user interface window with a single line of
    code
  - Support for multiple user interface windows
  - Standard user interface controls such as:
       - Buttons
       - Checkboxes for boolean variables
       - Radio Buttons for mutually-exclusive options
       - Editable text boxes for inputting text, integers, and
         floating-point values
       - Spinners for interactively manipulating integer and floating-point
         values
       - Static text fields
       - Panels for grouping sets of controls
       - Separator lines to help visually organize groups of controls
  - Controls can generate callbacks when their values change
  - Variables can be linked to controls and automatically updated when the
    value of the control changes ("live variables")
  - Controls can be automatically synchronized to reflect changes in live
    variables
  - Controls can trigger GLUT redisplay events when their values change
  - Layout and sizing of controls is automatic
  - Controls can be grouped into columns
  - User can cycle through controls using Tab key
