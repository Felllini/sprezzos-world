        elements than the current position in the former source was don't show
        an empty source that would be shown correctly after scrolling.
      - Add id3v2mux to the list of MP3 tag muxers if none was specified
      - before burning calculate the total duration of the selection and
        ensure the media is large enough to hold it.
  * debian/patches/05_cover-popup-scaling.diff:
    + Scale the cover popup if width or height are greater then 75% of the
