  * Non-maintainer upload.
  * alsa-base.modprobe: Fix snd module autoloading by adding a trailing
    ':', as is done for snd-rawmidi and snd-emu10k1. Since d-i's switch
    to kmod, speech synthesis would otherwise be broken for a number of
    devices (Closes: #685885). Thanks to Samuel Thibault for reporting,
    and Julien Cristau for the suggested patch.

alsa-base (1.0.25+2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Use dpkg-maintscript-helper to correctly remove /etc/apm/scripts.d/alsa
    conffile (closes: #673608).
  * Remove mentions of alsa-driver, alsa-source or building alsa-modules
    from alsa-base's description.
  * Decruft maintainer scripts:
    - use dpkg-maintscript-helper to handle previous conffile renames and
      removals, and remove obsolete pre-lenny code
    - stop installing a default file in /usr/share and make
      /etc/default/alsa a real conffile.
    - get rid of postinst entirely.
    - remove apm symlinks on preinst upgrade, not just postrm purge.
  * Rely on dh_installmodules, dh_bugfiles and dh_installdefault instead
    of manually installing corresponding files.
  * Update Vcs-* urls to point to alsa-base, not alsa-driver.
  * Remove obsolete alsa-base.modprobe-post-install.
  * Rewrite copyright file in machine-readable format 1.0, removing all

alsa-base (1.0.25+1) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Elimar Riesebieter ]
  * udev-related code removed from alsa-base.postinst (closes: #620786)

  [ Jordi Mallach ]
  * Depend on kmod, not module-init-tools (thanks, Markus Waldeck).
  * Rename source package, make it 3.0 (native).
  * Drop alsa-source and all related packaging for alsa-modules. It was
    painful to maintain, didn't make the kernel team happy at all and was
    a general mess. The recommended way of getting new drivers is to look
    for a kernel backport (closes: #627152, 622652 —RC—, and also
    closes: #228070, #481849, #570618, #584336, #588385, #606046, #612123
    closes: #653542)
  * Drop all patches, all applied to alsa-driver.
  * Do not install ALSA driver docs in alsa-base.
  * Rewrite rules in dh.
  * Bump to debhelper 9.
  * Refresh debconf po files to get rid of alsa-source msgids.
  * Drop watch file, we don't have an upstream tarball anymore.
  * Drop program-wrapper, it was useful for woody upgrades.
  * Add dependency on procps (closes: #634038).
  * Never call snddevices, udev should create devices for us
    (closes: #526648). Also, remove APM stuff, which is long obsolete.
  * Drop linux-sound-base: OSS was removed from the kernel pre-squeeze.
    (closes: #662038). Remove all module list generation machinery,
    it's now obsolete.
  * Removing linux-sound-base also closes: #376241, #558408 the hard way.
  * Drop Build-Depends on po-debconf.
  * Make alsa-base Break: linux-sound-base, to get it uninstalled on
    upgrades. l-s-b postrm should take care of the cleanups.
  * Bump Standards-Version to 3.9.3.
  * Drop d/source/options, use the standard compression.
  * Move d/alsa-base.init to just d/alsa, otherwise debhelper thinks this
    is a init script.
  * Move old Debian changelog entries back to main changelog.

alsa-driver (1.0.8-5) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Thomas Hood
    - alsa-base: Bump Dependency on alsa-utils to >= 1.0.8-2
    - Remove char-major-* aliases from /etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base
      since the kernel reportedly provides these  (Closes: #294238)
    - Add OSS module name 'cs461x' to blacklists
      (Closes: #294109 and Ubuntu#6328)
    - /etc/init.d/alsa
      - Add unload and reload methods which don't kill sound procs
        before they (try to) unload modules
      - Eliminate a variable name collision
      - Improve messages
      - Improve comments
    - Stop alsa later (at [06]:K40alsa) so that shutdown music keeps
      on playing while services are shut down  (Closes Ubuntu #6234)
    - Generate alsa-modules files with the required Dependency on
      either modutils or else module-init-tools (rather than their
      disjunction) (closes: #293312) and on the current alsa-base,
      and Recommend a current libasound2, and only Suggest
      pcmcia-modules packages for 2.4 kernels (closes: #293576).
    - alsa-modules* long description: Add warning about the fact that
      sound processes will be killed if upgrading modules for the
      running kernel.

  * Thomas Hood:
    - /etc/init.d/alsa:
      + In order to tell whether a command is executable, don't use
        "command -v" which, it turns out, isn't as well suited to this
        purpose as I earlier thought. (See #218530.)  Instead just try
        to execute the command (with --help) and check the error
        status.

alsa-driver (1.0.8-3) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Thomas Hood:
    - /etc/init.d/alsa:
      + Check for availability of alsactl and amixer using "command -v"
        before attempting to run them  (Closes: #291942)
      + Use #!/bin/bash because "command -v" is non-POSIX (see #218530)
    - /usr/share/doc/alsa-base/README.Debian:
      + Inform user that warning messages about alsactl or amixer not
        being found can be ignored if they occur as a result of the
        initscript being run in the boot process prior to /usr being
        mounted
    - /etc/mod(utils|probe.d)/alsa-base:
      + Add modprobe-post-install calls for snd-emu8000-synth so that
        the awesfx maintainer can arrange for asfxload to be run from
        /etc/alsa/modprobe-post-install.d/ when this module loads.
        (This would be to grant wish #246405.)  It seems that in
        earlier ALSA releases, asfxload had to be run after snd-sbawe
        was loaded, but now it has to be run after snd-emu8000-synth
        is loaded.  Thanks to Bodo Meissner for providing this
        information.

      + Move entries to changelog-old

  * Thomas Hood:
    - /etc/init.d/alsa
      + start, stop, restart methods now accept a CARD argument
        which can be either an ALSA card index or id or "all"
      + Make "force-unload" the canonical name for the method that
        unloads driver modules.  This should be less confusing.
      + Set mixer levels to default values if asound.state is missing
        or if alsactl fails for some other reason  (Closes: #291518)
      + On stop, zero mixer levels
      + Make suspend, resume work correctly for more than one card

      + Revise comments; add comment for ALSA_CARD_OPTIONS
    - /usr/share/doc/alsa-base/README.Debian
      + Recommend "force-unload" rather than "force-stop" for forcibly
        unloading modules.
    - /usr/share/doc/alsa-source/README.Debian
      + Improve advice for building alsa-modules for 2.6 kernels
    - *.config,*.postinst,*.postrm:
      + Use #!/bin/bash because confmodule uses "local" which is
        non-POSIX (see #252094)
    - alsa-source.config,postinst:
      + Preserve values of ALSA_NOPNP, ALSA_DEBUG, ALSA_CARD_OPTIONS,
        thus partially addressing #290946.
        ALSA_CARDS still gets creamed.  :(
    - alsa-source.rules
      + Add support for ALSA_CARD_OPTIONS
    - alsa-base.postinst
      + Don't create /var/lib/alsa/asound.state

    - Start alsa at 12 rather than at 20, following Ubuntu's lead
    - Add /lib/alsa/modprobe-post-install to replace the script of the
      same name in /usr/lib/alsa/ in the alsa-utils package; modify

    - Add /lib/alsa/dev to which the dev hook symlinks all now point.
      This does a run-parts on /etc/alsa/dev.d/.
    - debian/control

      + Create /var/run/alsa/ on start if it's absent
      + On force-stop, write list of removed modules to the file
        /var/run/alsa/modules-removed.  This is used for reloading
        modules after resume.
        (N.B. As of 1.0.8-2 you should use "force-unload" instead.)
      + Add "suspend" method which does force-stop and "resume"
        method which loads modules listed in the aforementioned file
        (N.B. As of 1.0.8-2 you should use "force-unload" instead.)

  * Thomas Hood:
    - debian/module-blacklist:
      + Add bt878.  Thanks to Reinhard Tartler for the tip.
        (Closes: #279327)
    - debian/rules, debian/alsa-base.(preinst|postinst|postrm|dirs):
      + Put alsa-base.dev in /etc/alsa/dev.d/ and symlink to it
        from /etc/dev.d/snd/controlC[0-3]/alsa-base.dev.  This
        scheme avoids running the script when it isn't needed.
        (Closes: #279405)
    - alsa-base.permissions:
      + Eliminate at the request of the udev maintainer
        (Closes: #279486)
    - alsa-base.dev
      + Take into account the possibility that /usr/ and/or /var/
        may not be mounted when this script runs.  Thanks to Marco
        d'Itri for the tips.  (Closes: #279325)

    - debian/control:
      + alsa-headers now Depends on libasound2-dev >= 1.0.6-3.
        This is required in order to guarantee that alsa-headers
        can be removed; older libasound2-dev releases depended on
        alsa-headers.

        those versions didn't allow modules to be blacklisted

      + Install alsa-base.discover as /etc/discover.d/alsa-base
        instead of as /usr/share/doc/alsa-base/alsa-base.discover.
        This stops discover1 from loading OSS modules at boot time
        so that ALSA modules can be loaded instead.  This only works
        with discover1 >= 1.7.2.  If you have an earlier version of
        discover1 or if you have discover (version 2) then this
        blacklist file has no effect.
        (Closes: #220616, #265845, #275794, #276272)

      + Don't pad '...' with spaces (as per policy 9.4)
      + On start, don't fail if attempt to restore mixer levels fails.
        In order to avoid lost races this should be done by the module

    - /etc/default/alsa

    - Heaven forbid that we actually remove features from the package, so
      reimplement force-stop in the init script, and tell the apm script
      to run force-stop on suspend. Getting modules to load on resume is

alsa-driver (1.0.4-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Steve Kowalik:
    - Actually do some work on this package!
    - Check for the presence of either devfs or udev before creating device 
      nodes in alsa-base's postinst. (Closes: #243876)
    - Rewrite the init script to not load modules. Loading modules is now 
      the responsibility of the user, or hotplug.
      (Closes: #195516, #203491, #210440, #232380, #237003, #237452, #240594)
      (Closes: #244068, #245783)
    - Stop alsa-base depending on lsof and procps.
    - Change the description for alsa-base to no longer mention module
      loading.
    - Rewrite the debconf-age for alsa-base:
      + Stop asking which modules to load. (Closes: #199739, #218655)
      + Only ask one question about saving mixer settings, in the style of
        setserial.
      + This means we can stop doing vile things to the debconf templates in
        debian/rules.
      + This also means that alsa can restore on bootup, and not save on
        shutdown. (Closes: #191501, #232854)
    - Remove the files under /etc/alsa/modutils, and the symlinks
      into /etc/modprobe.d and /etc/modutils.
    - Provide an alsa-base file under /etc/modprobe.d and /etc/modutils 
      which will load the OSS compatibility modules.
      (Closes: #229486, #240594)
    - Blacklist (for hotplug) and skip (for discover) the OSS sound modules.
      Note that we can include the blacklist automatically for hotplug, but
      discover doesn't contain the infrastructure for that, so the file for 
      discover is in /usr/share/doc/alsa-base.
      (Closes: #238278, #238694, #240125, #242720)
    - Due to the fact that the init script no longer touches modules, this
      script has been gutted to a shadow of its former self. (Closes: #238994)
    - Stop using install -d so liberally in debian/rules.
    - Rename debian/po/no.po to debian/po/nb.po.
    - Correct typo in debian/po/fr.po. (Closes: #245031) (thanks,
      Pierre Machard)

  * New upstream release
  * Jordi Mallach:
    - debian/control, debian/alsa-source.control: sync descriptions with
      alsa-lib's.
  * David B. Harris:
    - Re-disable the GCC version-check warning message, as we already check
      for this in debian/rules. I believe it got lost in the 1.0.2c-1 upload.
      It's just a cosmetic thing, as the logic to actually do the
      version-check was still disabled. (Closes: #234225)
    - Change my Uploaders: email address from my private address to
      dbharris@debian.org
    - debian/alsa-base.init: Produce a more helpful error message when
      'alsactl restore' fails. (Closes: #234233)
    - debian/control (alsa-base): Add version to alsa-utils dependency,
      1.0.2-2, so that the postinst's running of alsactl gets its state from
      the new location (/var/lib/alsa/asound.state)
    - debian/alsa-base.init: Add support to set the
      runlevels within which mixer settings will be saved (the same setting is
      also used to determine *from* which runlevels we'll be saving mixer
      settings). Now if you boot into single-user mode and reboot right from
      there, mixer settings won't be saved (so on your next boot you'll have
      your normal levels, not all-muted). (Closes: #233974)
    - Transition from /etc/modutils/alsa/0.9 to /etc/modutils/alsa/1.0
      (Closes: #233752):
      + debian/alsa-base.config: Use /etc/alsa/modutils/1.0 if it exists, and
        if it doesn't try to use /etc/alsa/modutils/0.9. Additionally, stop
        replacing /etc/modutils/alsa with a symlink if it's a non-symlink.
      + debian/alsa-base.examples, debian/modutils-0.9.conf: Move to
        modutils-1.0.conf
      + debian/alsa-base.postinst: Migrate /etc/alsa/modutils/0.9 to
        /etc/alsa/modutils/1.0, if the latter doesn't exist. Update
        /etc/{modprobe.d,modutils}/alsa symlinks if and only if they point to
        0.9
      + debian/alsa-base.postrm: Remove /etc/{modprobe.d,modutils}/alsa and
        known conffiles /etc/alsa/modutils/ on purge
      + debian/alsa-base.README.Debian: Update
      + debian/alsa-source.README.Debian: Update
    - debian/alsa-common.templates: Remove extraneous "," which would cause
      'harmony (PCI: Harmony/Vivace sound chip)' to show up as two options.

      Rules.make.
    - Add a binary target to debian/rules in alsa-source.

      + Be warned that alsa-base may re-ask for your driver modules due to
        the question name changing.

        re-add the last driver module to the list every time the package was

  * New upstream release.
  * debian/alsa-source_VERSION_.README.debian.in: actually modify this file,
    not the generated one (really closes: #163343).
  * debian/debconf/Makefile.in: rework the makefile to handle split templates.
  * debian/debconf/cards: replace via686 and via8833 with via88xx.
  * debian/debconf/templates_VERSION_.templ.in: split into
    templates_VERSION_.templ.{de,ja,ru}.in. Some are outdated.
    This whole debian/debconf thing is an evil, big hack...
  * debian/scripts/vars: bump TAR_DIR to 0.9.0rc5.
  * debian/modules.d/control.module{,-image}.in: adjust depends for rc5.
  * debian/patches/001_remove_isapnp_h: removed.
  * debian/patches/005_ac97_patch_c_define_no_version: removed.
  * debian/rules: remove isapnp.h workarounds from rc3.
  * debian/sys-build.mk: source.clean wasn't removing $(STAMP_DIR) properly.
    Scary change, because I still don't get much of what goes on in DBS.
  * Powerpc driver compiles ok in this new version (closes: #165889).
  * emu10k1 build fixed (closes: #147720).

  * The "I hate this package" release.
  * debian/modules-tools.d/rules: add support for kernel-package's
    --rootcmd. Thanks to Adrian 'Dagurashibanipal' von Bidder for pointing
    me at Brian May's pcmcia-source patch (closes: #161913).
  * debian/rules: remove include/linux/isapnp.h from the current directory,
    not just from the build dir. It wasn't fixed for the alsa-source
    tar.gz... (thanks, Daniel Müller; closes: #164801, really).
  * debian/patches/002_linux_2_2_0_compile_fix: sigh. Looks like this patch
    is obsolete. *Should* fix compiles on 2.2.20. No, I have not tested. I
    can't download 6 different kernels every time I work on this (thanks,
    Shinichi Sakata; closes: #115757, #162378).
  * debian/init: restore the "enable_sound_devs" call. It was fscking device
    perms for many people (thanks, Daniel Burrows; reopens: #141546).
  * debian/alsa-source.README.debian: add a few extra notes for people
    building module .debs without kernel-package (thanks, Dave Barr;
    closes: #163343).
  * Looks like not everything was broken. Submitter says this is *still*
    working with rc3. We'll see in rc4... (closes: #52564).
  * People, really. The state of this package is still deplorable. We need
    some help with devfs bugs and with alsa-base's init script in general.
    We also need to report all our bugs to ALSA upstreams... I still haven't
    found time to tag them apropiately even, much less to write a list of
    problems to their mailing list. If you think you can help, please contact
    me. I'm willing to continue doing Non-Maintainer ALSA work, but not alone.

    bashisms, use /bin/sh instead of /bin/bash.
  * debian/alsa-source.templates: split into lang-independent files (de, ja,

    + add quotes around checks for ALSA_DEBUG and ALSA_NOPNP so the ifeq
      actually works (thanks, Timshel; (closes: #113717).

  * New upstream version.  There must have been something very wrong with
    0.3.1, it seems.
  * Renamed the alsa-modules package to alsa-base.  In a sane and
    reasonable universe, alsa-modules would be the virtual package
    currently known as alsadriver.  This may yet come to pass.
  * Added some "correctness" fixes to the init script. (eliminated useless
    uses of cat, grep, and backslashes).  Also made it use alsactl if
    available, since the new mixer interface requires this.
  * Juggled the dependencies in the hope of making this package a bit
    easier to deal with.

alsadriver (0.3.0-pre4-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Enabled ISA PnP support.  Autodetection doesn't work on PnP cards,
    though.  Darn.
  * Moved a period from one side of a single quote to the other (Bug
    #36963)
  * Slightly hacked alsaconfig and /etc/init.d/alsa so they actually work
    (should fix Bug #33605)
  * Fixed several thinkos in debian/rules that resulted in seemingly bogus
    lintian errors.
  * Added dependency on 'make' to the alsa-source package.
  * Updated the alsa web site in copyright.Debian.
  * Now creates /dev/snd symlink in the postinst (Bug #37522, but I'm not
    sure this actually violated policy...)
  * postrm for alsa-modules now behaves correctly.
