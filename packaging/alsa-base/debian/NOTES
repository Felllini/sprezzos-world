                      for alsa-base


TODO possibly
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Add alsa package?:

Package: alsa
Architecture: all
Depends: alsa-base, alsa-utils
Description: ALSA metapackage
 Install this package in order to pull in the packages
 needed to use the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture.

changelog entry:
    - Add "alsa" metapackage Depending on alsa-base and alsa-utils

NOTES
~~~~~

* Scripts run by modprobe (because of "install" entries in
  /etc/modprobe.d/*) inherit PATH from whatever runs modprobe.
  Remember that modprobe is run with PATH=/bin:/sbin from
  /etc/init.d/module-init-tools, so such scripts should be careful
  about running commands in /usr/sbin/ and /usr/bin/.

* We considered creating /dev/[snd/]aload(C[0-7]|SEQ) but it was
  decided that this doesn't deliver much benefit.  We have added
  module loader configuration lines that cause the module loader to
  load auxiliary modules on top of card driver modules.  Automatic
  loading in the presence of udev doesn't always work properly.

* If a module loader configuration line for a card driver module is
  added to /etc/mod(utils|probe.d)/alsa-base then the NOPOSTINSTALL
  tag should be added to that module's description in ALSA-card-list
  so that no configuration line will be autogenerated for it.
