Description: LaTeX class to produce presentations
 The beamer class is a LaTeX class that allows you to create a beamer
 presentation. It can also be used to create slides. It behaves
 similarly to other packages like Prosper, but has the advantage that
 it works together directly with pdflatex, but also with dvips.
 .
 Once you have installed the beamer class, the basic steps to create a
 beamer presentation are the following:
  - Specify beamer as document class instead of article.
  - Structure your LaTeX text using \section and \subsection commands.
  - Place the text of the individual slides inside \frame commands.
  - Run pdflatex on the text (or latex and dvips).
 .
 The beamer class has several useful features: You don't need any
 external programs to use it other than pdflatex, but it works also
 with dvips. You can easily and intuitively create sophisticated
 overlays. Finally, you can easily change the whole slide theme or only
 parts of it.
