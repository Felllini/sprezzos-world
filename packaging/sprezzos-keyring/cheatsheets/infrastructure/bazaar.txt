Bazaar working tree
-------------------

Keyring work is coordinated in the Bazaar tree living in
/org/keyring.debian.org/master-keyring/ at keyring.debian.org (which
is an alias to kaufmann.debian.org). You need to have an account on
kaufmann to get access to the working tree -  After some Bazaar breakage, I
have found the stable, working URL for this branch to be:

nosmart+sftp://kaufmann.debian.org/org/keyring.debian.org/master-keyring/

You should _always_ work in "bound mode" (i.e. using Bazaar as a
centralized VCS), unless you have a good reason not to. Just:

$ bzr checkout nosmart+sftp://kaufmann.debian.org/org/keyring.debian.org/master-keyring/
$ cd master-keyring
$ bzr bind

There is a public copy of the tree we push to whenever we push the
updates; it is available at Debian's bzr server:

bzr+ssh://bzr.debian.org/bzr/keyring/debian-keyring

So, when you push a new revision, do:

$ bzr push --create-prefix bzr+ssh://bzr.debian.org/bzr/keyring/debian-keyring

Configure Bazaar to always sign commit messages - Add the following to
your ~/.bazaar/bazaar.conf (of course, with your data instead of
mine):

[DEFAULT]
email = Gunnar Wolf <gwolf@debian.org>
create_signatures = always
check_signatures = always
