ardour (0.9beta10.2-1) unstable; urgency=low
  
     This release disables optimization for i386 because otherwise the
     binaries fail on k6 and such. Read
     <http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=234371> and
     <http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=219672>.
     If you want to build an optimized version, read, edit and uncomment 
     the part in debian/rules and rebuild.

ardour (0.9beta9+3-2) unstable; urgency=low

     The Manual (formerly contained in the package ardour-doc) has been
     removed. It contained the skeleton an a few bits of information that were
     already quite outdated.
     .
     The Ardour developers (mainly Paul Davis) have decided develop an
     extensive manual that will be sold and will not be freely distributable.
     The discussion about this can be found in the Ardour mailing lists (such
     as <http://boudicca.tux.org/hypermail/ardour-dev/>).
     .
     A scrambled version (making reproduction and/or use harder) may be
     available from the project's homepage <http://ardour.sourceforge.net>.
     The homepage also contains information about the version of the manual
     that will be sold.
     .
     This scrambled manual contains much more information than the version
     formerly contained in ardour-doc.
