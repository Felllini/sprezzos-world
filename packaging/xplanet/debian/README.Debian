xplanet for Debian
------------------

Please note this package includes some imagery for planet Earth, but it 
does not intended to be an imagery repository.

If you need a greater resolution, or imagery for some other bodies, you 
must provide your own imagery.

Upstream doesn't want to ï»¿enlarge his tarball including more images. 
However, he lists some planetary and cloud map sources in his web:

Thank you.
