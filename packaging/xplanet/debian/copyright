 Images provided by NASA.
 .
 earth.jpg and night.jpg are from http://visibleearth.nasa.gov/, their 
 Terms of Use are include below.
 .
 hubble.png, iss.png and shuttle.png from http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/, 
 their Guidelines for Use of Imagery are include below.
 .
 NASA Terms of Use
 (From: http://visibleearth.nasa.gov/useterms.php)
 .
 For all non-private uses, NASA's Terms Of Use are as follows:
    1. The imagery is free of licensing fees
    2. NASA requires that they be provided a credit as the owners of the 
       imagery
 .
 Visible Earth Addendum
 .
 Beyond the NASA Terms, the Visible Earth team requests, but does not 
 require:
    1. The Visible Earth be provided a credit as the location that the 
       imagery was found at
    2. A URL be provided, either to the Visible Earth 
       (http://visibleearth.nasa.gov/) or to the page providing the link 
       to the used image.
 .
 Guidelines for Use of NASA Imagery
 (From: http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/gallery/guidelines_nasa_imagery.pdf)
 .
 As a government entity, NASA does not “license” the use of NASA  
 materials or sign license agreements. The Agency generally has no 
 objection to the reproduction and use of these materials (audio 
 transmissions and recordings; video transmissions and recording; or 
 still and motion picture photography), subject to the following 
 conditions:
   * NASA material may not be used to state or imply the endorsement by 
     NASA or by any NASA employee of a commercial product, service, or 
     activity, or used in any manner that might mislead.
   * NASA should be acknowledged as the source of the material.
   * It is unlawful to falsely claim copyright or other rights in NASA 
     material.
   * NASA shall in no way be liable for any costs, expenses, claims, or 
     demands arising out of the use of NASA material by a recipient or a 
     recipient’s distributees.
   * NASA does not indemnify nor hold harmless users of NASA material, 
     nor release such users from copyright infringement, nor grant 
     exclusive use rights with respect to NASA material.
   * NASA material is not protected by copyright unless noted. If 
     copyrighted, permission should be obtained from he copyright owner 
     prior to use. If not copyrighted, NASA material may be reproduced 
     and distributed without further permission from NASA.
   * If a recognizable person, or talent (e.g., an astronaut or a noted 
     personality engaged to narrate a film) appears in NASA material, 
     use for commercial purposes may infringe a right of privacy or 
     publicity. Therefore, permission should be obtained from the 
     recognizable person or talent if the proposed use of the NASA 
     material could be viewed as a commercial exploitation of that 
     person. However, if the intended use of NASA material is primarily 
     for communicative purposes, i.e., books, newspapers, and magazines 
     reporting facts of historical significance (constitutionally 
     protected media uses), then such uses will generally be considered 
     not to infringe such personal rights.
   * Some NASA audiovisual material may incorporate music or footage, 
     which is copyrighted and licensed for the particular NASA work. 
     Any editing or otherwise altering of the work may not be covered 
     under the original license, and therefore would require permission 
     of the copyright owner.
   * NASA audiovisual material may include visible NASA identifiers 
     (e.g., the name of the vehicle and the NASA Insignia or Logotype in 
     photographs or film footage of Space Shuttle vehicles). Use of such 
     materials is generally non-objectionable, provided the NASA 
     identifiers appear in their factual context.
