opendkim (2.1.3+dfsg-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.
  * opendkim is now under the 3-clause BSD license, although the Sendmail-
    owned components remain under the Sendmail license. The copyright file
    has been updated to reflect this change.
  * Debian-specific patch to include libresolv in libar to work around -z defs
    as a linker flag. This library isn't meant for consumption by other source
    packages, but using -z defs does cause a build failure, and I'd rather
    keep the error in than risk missing a dependency because it's gone.
  * libopendkim's major version number has changed; rename to libopendkim2

    - libopendkim0 package renamed to libopendkim1.
  * New LDAP and Lua support have been enabled.
  * Wrote clearer package descriptions. Closes: #572725

    very old config.sub and config.guess files, but this will be resolved
    upstream in the near future.
    - Also removed extraneous top-level config.{sub,guess} files.
  * Applied two upstream patches for off-by-one errors, including one that can
    cause crashes when signing.
  * debian/copyright file was not accurate; it has been updated to reflect the
    fork from the dkim-milter project. The dkim-milter license should be fully
    compatible with the BSD license of this fork.
