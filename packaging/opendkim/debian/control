Description: Milter implementation of DomainKeys Identified Mail
 The OpenDKIM Project is a community effort to develop and maintain a C library
 for producing DKIM-aware applications and an open source milter for providing
 DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) service.
 .
 DKIM provides a way for senders to confirm their identity when sending email
 by adding a cryptographic signature to the headers of the message.
 .
 This package contains the OpenDKIM mail filter (Milter) for plugging into
 Milter-aware MTAs. It implements both signing and verification.

Description: Library for RFC 5518 Vouch By Reference (VBR)
 The OpenDKIM Project is a community effort to develop and maintain a C library
 for producing DKIM-aware applications and an open source milter for providing
 DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) service.
 .
 This package provides library for implementing RFC 5518 Vouch By Reference
 (VBR), a peer-to-peer domain reputation service protocol based on DKIM signed
 domains.
 .
 Vouch By Reference, or VBR, is a protocol for adding third-party
 certification to email.  Specifically, VBR permits independent third parties
 to certify the owner of a domain name that is associated with received mail.
 VBR may be performed anywhere along the email transit path, by any capable
 receiving module, either within the handling service or by end-user software.
