AutoDock and AutoGrid are free software, distributed under the terms of
the GNU General Public License 2 or later. This allows us to share the
code and to be open for improvement from the whole scientific community.

The development of the AutoDock suite is entirely funded by research
grants.  For that reason, we ask you to register at the AutoDock
Registration page

          http://autodock.scripps.edu/downloads/autodock-registration

in order to keep track of number of unique downloads, which we use to
support the grant applications. Installing the Debian popularity-contest
package is also encouraged.

     Thank you, and happy docking!

                                     The AutoDock Development Team

If you plan to use AutoDock for commercial purposes we encourage
donations to the Olson laboratory to help support further development
of the AutoDock 4 suite of programs.  Donation information provided on
the download page.
