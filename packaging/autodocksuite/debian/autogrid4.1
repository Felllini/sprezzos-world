.SH NAME
autogrid \- preparing protein and ligand for AutoDock analysis
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B autogrid4
.RI [ options ]
\-p
.RI gridparameterfile
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B AutoGrid
prepares a 3D grid representation of the non-covalent interaction
energies that various user-specified ligand atom types will experience
around a user-specified target macromolecule.  In addition, the
electrostatic potential and desolvation free energy grid maps may also
be calculated.  The grid maps are stored in plain text files with the
extension '.map' and are required by AutoDock 4 to perform dockings.
AutoGrid also outputs a '.xyz' file which describes the spatial
extents of the grid box, and an AVS field '.fld' file which describes
the consistent set of atomic affinity grid maps that were calculated
together for a given target macromolecule. Note: it is necessary
to compute grid maps for all the atom types in the ligand or set of
ligands that will be docked, as well as an electrostatic potential
grid map and a desolvation free energy map. For example, if a ligand
has an aliphatic carbon and a hydrogen-bond-accepting oxygen atom,
it would be necessary to compute both a 'C' map and an 'OA' map.  See
http://autodock.scripps.edu/faqs-help/faq/where-do-i-set-the-autodock-4-force-field-parameters
for more information about AutoDock 4 atom types.

The input to
.RI AutoGrid
is best prepared with the program suite
.RI AutoDockTools.
There is no way to run
.RI autodock4
without a grid.

.SH EXAMPLE
A range of tests is made available with the AutoGrid sources that can be used as follows:
.br
$ D=/usr/share/doc/autogrid/Tests
.br
$ cd /tmp
.br
$ ln \-s $D/AD4_parameters.dat .
.br
$ gunzip \-c $D/hsg1_sm.pdbqt.gz > hsg1_sm.pdbqt
.br
.nh
$ autogrid4 \-p $D/hsg1_no_receptor_types.gpf \-l hsg1_no_receptor_types.glg
.ad b
.TP
This command prepares grid map files for each of the AutoDock atom types specified in the grid parameter file (in this case: hsg1_sm.A.map, hsg1_sm.C.map, hsg1_sm.d.map, hsg1_sm.e.map, hsg1_sm.HD.map, hsg1_sm.NA.map, hsg1_sm.N.map, hsg1_sm.OA.map), the AVS field file (hsg1_sm.maps.fld) and hsg1_sm.maps.xyz. To perform the cocking calculation, AutoDock should be executed, though it demands a separate docking parameter file (with extension .dpf).  The 'DPF' refers to the grid map files that are necessary to the docking and allows the setting of other important parameters, such as the search method and how many dockings to perform.
