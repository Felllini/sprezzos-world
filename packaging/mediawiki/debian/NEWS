mediawiki (1:1.19.2-2) unstable; urgency=low

  The mediawiki-extensions-fckeditor package has been
  deprecated by the Wikimedia foundation and will not
  work with this version of MediaWiki. If your wikis
  have been using this extension, please remove it from
  their configuration to avoid breakage. This can be
  done using "sudo mwdisext FCKeditor.php" if installed
  from Debian packaging.

mediawiki (1:1.19.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  SQL structure changes are required for this release of mediawiki.
  This does not take place automatically and mediawiki will not function
  until they are completed.

  For upgrades of mediawiki, the $wgDBadminuser and $wgDBadminpassword variables
  probably need setting in /etc/mediawiki/AdminSettings.php. The user chosen for
  this role should have all roles granted on the database (debian-sys-maint
  might be a good choice for this).
 
  /etc/mediawiki/AdminSettings.php should be owned by root and set 0600.
 
  When everything is prepared, start the update by running (as root):
    php /usr/share/mediawiki/maintenance/update.php
