cmtk for Debian
---------------

Upstream carries needed 3rd-part modules (DCMTK, mxml, etc) under
Utilities.  To reduce the size of the .orig.tar.gz and guarantee the
use of system-wide available versions of those 3rd party libraries,
.orig.tar.gz are stripped of them.  CMTK package version though
doesn't carry .dfsg suffix since per-se those removals are done not to
achieve DFSG-compliance.
