Description: Linux console and font utilities
 This package allows you to set-up and manipulate the Linux console (ie.
 screen and keyboard), and manipulate console-font files.
 .
 `console-tools' was developed from version 0.94 of the standard `kbd'
 package, and integrates many fixes and enhancements, including new
 kbd features up to 0.99.
 .
 You will probably want to install a set of data files, such as the one
 in the `console-data' package.

 For command-line compatibility with kbd, you may want to install the
 kbd-compat package.
