  * Fixed kbdconfig to correctly handle keymap trees with several keymaps
    with the same name in different directories.
  * Added missing quotes around shell wildcards in kbdconfig (Closes:
    Bug#41069).
  * Removed my dh_installinit as new one includes needed feature.
  * Moved manpages to /usr/share.
  * Added missing ${DESTDIR} refs to compat/Makefile.am.
  * Run `make install' with gnulocaledir= as workaround of gettext
    po/Makefile.in.in not supporting DESTDIR.
  * Made /etc/init.d/console-screen.sh do nothing when called with
    "stop" as parameter.
  * Cleaned up copyright file from obsolete references.
  * Install manpages in /usr/share to comply with FHS (now lintian
    complains).
  * Bumped Standards-Version to 3.0.0.

console-tools (1:0.2.0-4) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Make sure console-tools-data is installed before building, by
    aborting the "build" target since we do not have source dependencies
    yet (Closes: Bug#39211).
  * Fixed "rmdir -p" invokations for POSIX compliance.

console-tools (1:0.2.0-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Really get deps on -libs package right (was a bad LD_LIBRARY_PATH
    setting invoking dh_shlibdeps) (Fixes: Bug#38245).

 -- Yann Dirson <dirson@debian.org>  Mon,  7 Jun 1999 23:11:06 +0200

console-tools (1:0.2.0-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Set priority to required.

    scripts (Fixes: Bug#36311, Bug#37568).
  * Moved rc.boot script to init.d as console-screen.sh (Fixes:

    upstream package.

console-tools (1998.08.11-2) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * This is only a packaging change, which fixes confusing messages when
    selecting the keymap, so this should go into frozen.  Also I did not
    fix the version before uploading the previous version, which made it
    ugly and non-standard.
  
  * Install .desc files in the correct locations, so that kbdconfig gives
    meaningfull messages when navigating the keymaps tree (discovered when
    reading report for Bug#32338 ;).
  * Fixed a spelling error in description (thanx lintian).

    other-latin0.inc, ua.kmap, sk-*.kmap, lat0*.psf, lat2u-16.psf) and
    docs (README.Euro, LISEZMOI.Euro).
  * Generated pl1.kmap with input from Marcin 'Qrczak' Kowalczyk (grep
    -v 'Alt ' pl.kmap > pl1.kmap)
  * Removed kbd.FAQ.* which is also in the HOWTOs (Fixes: Bug#23747).
  * Included mac-fr3.kmap from Marc Shapiro.
