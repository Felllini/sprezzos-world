Description: flexible binary data format in OCaml
 Biniou is a binary data format designed for speed, safety, ease of use
 and backward compatibility as protocols evolve. Biniou is vastly
 equivalent to JSON in terms of functionality but allows implementations
 about 4 times as fast (see godi-yojson for comparison), with 25-35%
 space savings. Biniou data can be decoded into human-readable form
 without knowledge of type definitions except for field and variant names
 which are represented by 31-bit hashes.
