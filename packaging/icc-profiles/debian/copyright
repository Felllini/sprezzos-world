 License
 .
 THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE
 COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE ("CCPL" OR "LICENSE"). THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY
 COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS
 AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS PROHIBITED.
 .
 BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO
 BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS
 CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND
 CONDITIONS.
 .
 1. Definitions
   1. "Collective Work" means a work, such as a periodical issue, anthology
 or encyclopedia, in which the Work in its entirety in unmodified form, along
 with a number of other contributions, constituting separate and independent
 works in themselves, are assembled into a collective whole. A work that
 constitutes a Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work (as
 defined below) for the purposes of this License.
   2. "Derivative Work" means a work based upon the Work or upon the Work and
 other pre-existing works, such as a translation, musical arrangement,
 dramatization, fictionalization, motion picture version, sound recording, art
 reproduction, abridgment, condensation, or any other form in which the Work
 may be recast, transformed, or adapted, except that a work that constitutes a
 Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of
 this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical
 composition or sound recording, the synchronization of the Work in
 timed-relation with a moving image ("synching") will be considered a
 Derivative Work for the purpose of this License.
   3. "Licensor" means the individual or entity that offers the Work under the
 terms of this License.
   4. "Original Author" means the individual or entity who created the Work.
   5. "Work" means the copyrightable work of authorship offered under the
 terms of this License.
   6. "You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this License
 who has not previously violated the terms of this License with respect to the
 Work, or who has received express permission from the Licensor to exercise
 rights under this License despite a previous violation.
 .
 2. Fair Use Rights. Nothing in this license is intended to reduce, limit, or
 restrict any rights arising from fair use, first sale or other limitations on
 the exclusive rights of the copyright owner under copyright law or other
 applicable laws.
 .
 3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License,
 Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual
 (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights
 in the Work as stated below: 
 .
   1. to reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more
 Collective Works, and to reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collective
 Works;
   2. to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform
 publicly, and perform publicly by means of a digital audio transmission the
 Work including as incorporated in Collective Works;
   3. The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now
 known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such
 modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other
 media and formats, but otherwise you have no rights to make Derivative Works.
 All rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved, including
 but not limited to the rights set forth in Sections 4(d) and 4(e).
 .
 4. Restrictions.The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made
 subject to and limited by the following restrictions:
   a. You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly
 digitally perform the Work only under the terms of this License, and You must
 include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for, this License with
 every copy or phonorecord of the Work You distribute, publicly display,
 publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform. You may not offer or impose
 any terms on the Work that alter or restrict the terms of this License or the
 recipients' exercise of the rights granted hereunder. You may not sublicense
 the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to
 the disclaimer of warranties. You may not distribute, publicly display,
 publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work with any
 technological measures that control access or use of the Work in a manner
 inconsistent with the terms of this License Agreement. The above applies to
 the Work as incorporated in a Collective Work, but this does not require the
 Collective Work apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of
 this License. If You create a Collective Work, upon notice from any Licensor
 You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collective Work any
 credit as required by clause 4(c), as requested.
   b. You may not exercise any of the rights granted to You in Section 3 above
 in any manner that is primarily intended for or directed toward commercial
 advantage or private monetary compensation. The exchange of the Work for other
 copyrighted works by means of digital file-sharing or otherwise shall not be
 considered to be intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or
 private monetary compensation, provided there is no payment of any monetary
 compensation in connection with the exchange of copyrighted works.
   c. If you distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly
 digitally perform the Work, You must keep intact all copyright notices for the
 Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the
 name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or
 (ii) if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties
 (e.g. a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution in
 Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable means,
 the name of such party or parties; the title of the Work if supplied; and to
 the extent reasonably practicable, the Uniform Resource Identifier, if any,
 that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does
 not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work. Such
 credit may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in
 the case of a Collective Work, at a minimum such credit will appear where any
 other comparable authorship credit appears and in a manner at least as
 prominent as such other comparable authorship credit.
 .
   d. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical composition:
 .
     i. Performance Royalties Under Blanket Licenses. Licensor reserves the
 exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a performance rights
 society (e.g. ASCAP, BMI, SESAC), royalties for the public performance or
 public digital performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work if that performance is
 primarily intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private
 monetary compensation.
     ii. Mechanical Rights and Statutory Royalties. Licensor reserves the
 exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a music rights agency
 or designated agent (e.g. Harry Fox Agency), royalties for any phonorecord You
 create from the Work ("cover version") and distribute, subject to the
 compulsory license created by 17 USC Section 115 of the US Copyright Act (or
 the equivalent in other jurisdictions), if Your distribution of such cover
 version is primarily intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or
 private monetary compensation.
 .
   e. Webcasting Rights and Statutory Royalties. For the avoidance of doubt,
 where the Work is a sound recording, Licensor reserves the exclusive right to
 collect, whether individually or via a performance-rights society (e.g.
 SoundExchange), royalties for the public digital performance (e.g. webcast)
 of the Work, subject to the compulsory license created by 17 USC Section 114
 of the US Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other jurisdictions), if Your
 public digital performance is primarily intended for or directed toward
 commercial advantage or private monetary compensation.
 .
 5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer
 .
 UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS
 THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND
 CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING,
 WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A
 PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER
 DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT
 DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED
 WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
 .
 6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW,
 IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY
 SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT
 OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF
 THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
 .
 7. Termination
 .
   1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
 automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals
 or entities who have received Collective Works from You under this License,
 however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or
 entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6,
 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.
   2. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is
 perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work).
 Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work
 under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time;
 provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this
 License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted
 under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full force
 and effect unless terminated as stated above.
 .
 8. Miscellaneous
 .
   a. Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform the Work or a
 Collective Work, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on
 the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this
 License.
   b. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under
 applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the
 remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the
 parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum
 extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
   c. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no
 breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and
 signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.
   d. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with
 respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements or
 representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall
 not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any communication
 from You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written
 agreement of the Licensor and You.
