   The original RasMol manual was created by Roger Sayle. In July 1996, Dr.
   Margaret Wong of the Chemistry Department, Swinburne University of
   Technology, Australia, made extensive revisions to the RasMol 2.5 manual
   to accurately reflect the operation of RasMol 2.6. Eric Martz of the
   University of Massachusetts made further revisions. In May 1997, William
   McClure of Carnegie Mellon University reorganized the HTML version of the
   manual into multiple sections which could be downloaded quickly and added
   use of frames. Portions of the 2.7.1 version of the RasMol manual were
   derived with permission from William McClure's version using Roger Sayle's
   rasmol.doc for version 2.6.4 as the primary source. Changes were made in
   August 2000 for RasMol version 2.7.2, January 2001 for RasMol version
   2.7.1.1 and April 2001 for RasMol version 2.7.2.1 and February 2005 for
   RasMol version 2.7.3.

 .
   Thanks to the efforts of Jose Miguel Fernandez Fernandez (Departamento de
   Bioquimica y Biologia Molecular. Universidad de Granada. Espana
   (jmfernan@ugr.es)) a translation of the Manual for Rasmol version 2.7.1
   into Spanish is now available. La traduccion espanola del manual de la
   version de la Dra. Wong revisada por Eric Martz fue realizada por Isabel
   Servan Martinez y Jose Miguel Fernandez Fernandez. La actual traduccion
   del Manual de RasMol 2.7.1 ha sido realizada usando como base la anterior
   de RasMol 2.6 por  Jose Miguel Fernandez Fernandez.

   Thanks to translations by Fernando Gabriel Ranea <davinci@dinamica.com.ar>
   in late 2000 and early 2001, RasMol is now capable of rendering most menu
   items and messages in Spanish. Jean-Pierre Demailly
   <Jean-Pierre.Demailly@ujf-grenoble.fr> provided French translations of
   menus and messages in January 2001. Giuseppe Martini
   <martini@iigb.na.cnr.it> and Giovanni Paolella <paolella@dbbm.unina.it>
   with contributions by A. Davassi, M. Masullo and C. Liotto provided
   Italian translations of menus and messages in March 2001.
