This Rasmol is for Debian. Contained are both the classic Unix Rasmol with
the Xlib-based user interface (/usr/bin/rasmol-classic) and a version with
the user interface based on the GTK library (/usr/bin/rasmol-gtk).

The /usr/bin/rasmol command can be switched to either one of these by using
the 'alternatives' mechanism of Debian (see man update-alternatives). By
default, the GTK version is launched.
