X-Comment: This file does not have an explicit license. According to
 lib/HTML/Tidy.pm it is a contribution to the HTML-Tidy distribution,
 therefore the same license as for the rest of the module is assumed.
 Additionally putting code "under the same terms as Perl itself" is what the
 author usually does for his Perl code.
