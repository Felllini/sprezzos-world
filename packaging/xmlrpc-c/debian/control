Description: lightweight RPC library based on XML and HTTP [C++ development libraries]
 XML-RPC is a quick-and-easy way to make procedure calls over the Internet.
 It converts the procedure call into an XML document, sends it to a remote
 server using HTTP, and gets back the response as XML.
 .
 This library provides a modular implementation of XML-RPC for C++.
 .
 Install this package if you wish to develop your own programs using this
 library.

Description: lightweight RPC library based on XML and HTTP [transitional package]
 XML-RPC is a quick-and-easy way to make procedure calls over the Internet.
 It converts the procedure call into an XML document, sends it to a remote
 server using HTTP, and gets back the response as XML.
 .
 This is an empty package for transitional purposes, and can be safely
 removed.

Description: Generate C++ wrapper classes for XML-RPC servers
 XML-RPC is a quick-and-easy way to make procedure calls over the Internet.
 It converts the procedure call into an XML document, sends it to a remote
 server using HTTP, and gets back the response as XML.
 .
 This package contains two programs:
  * xml-rpc-api2cpp, a utility for generating C++ wrapper classes based
    on an XML-RPC API, obtained by interrogating an XML-RPC server.
  * xml-rpc-api2txt, a utility for printing out an XML-RPC API as a
    text file.  The API is obtained by interrogating an XML-RPC server.
