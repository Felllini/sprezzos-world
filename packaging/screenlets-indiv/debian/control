Description: Widget-like mini-applications for GNOME
 Screenlets are small owner-drawn applications (written in Python, a 
 very simple object-oriented programming-language) that can be described as 
 "the virtual representation of things lying/standing around on your desk". 
 Sticknotes, clocks, rulers, the possibilities are endless.
