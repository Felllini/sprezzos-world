Description: run shell commands transparently within perl
 This package is included as a show case, illustrating a few Perl features.
 It shouldn't be used for production programs. Although it does provide a
 simple interface for obtaining the standard output of arbitrary commands,
 there may be better ways of achieving what you need.
