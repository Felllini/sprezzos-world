ledit for Debian
----------------
  * Removed the ocaml wrapper, since it caused problems with scripts calling
    ocaml, which didn't needed ledit.

    You can use ledit by simply using it with your interactive command, like
    in "ledit ocaml", "ledit coqtop" or "ledit whatever". Don't use a pipe, it
    will break program termination.
