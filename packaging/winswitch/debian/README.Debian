VBOX support
------------

VirtualBox support is ambiguous and non-intuitive.
By default Winswitch tries to populate local VBOX sessions which
can be prevented by starting winswitch as

    winswitch_applet --no-virtualbox

or using menu shortcut.

Alternatively one can modify configuration file

    ~/.winswitch/server/protocols/virtualbox.conf

to make sure it have "enabled=False".
