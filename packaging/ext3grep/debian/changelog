ext3grep (0.10.1-3.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix FTBFS (Closes: #634412)
    + some versions of the ext2 headers call a field s_frags_per_group and some
      call it s_clusters_per_group, define one to the other so the code works 
      with both
    + i_reseved2 has been split into two fields in recent versions of the 
      headers, use the "hurd" side of the union to continue to access it in
      one piece
  * Add sh4 to arch list. (Closes: #617447)
