libqglviewer (2.3.1-2) experimental; urgency=low

  * If you never compiled any software with libqglviewer you can safely ignore
    content of this note.
  * Since 2.2.6-3-4 libqglviewer is available in two flavours:
    + linked with Qt3: packages: libqglviewer-qt3-2 and libqglviewer-qt3-dev
    + linked with Qt4: packages: libqglviewer-qt4-2 and libqglviewer-qt4-dev
  * libqglviewer2 is a dummy package depending on libqglviewer-qt3-2
    for satysfying versioned dependency on the package
  * libqglviewer-qt3-2 Conflicts with older libqglviewer2
  * libqglviewer-dev is a dummy package depending on libqglviewer-qt3-dev,
    please note, that important paths has changed - you need to update include
    path, shared library name and static library name (if used)
  * I tried to do this multi-flavour compilation as unobtrusive for normal
    users as possible - it should be unnoticeable for them. If not - please
    submit a bug. But if you are a developer you need to made changes to your
    software. In case of problems please contact me directly.
  * Both libqglviewer-dev and libqglviewer2 is a special offer available for
    a limited time only - please update your package ASAP :)
