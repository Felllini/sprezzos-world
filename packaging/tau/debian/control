Description: Tuning and Analysis Utilities - base profiling toolkit
 TAU is a profiling toolkit specially made for parallel computing
 (multi-thread, multi-process, MPI, PVM).  It consists of an
 instrumentation API, which can be used manually (or added
 automatically by other instrumentation tools) to get runtime
 profiling information.
 .
 This package provides the API and library, and the command-line
 analysis tool.  A Tcl/Tk-based GUI is available in package tau-racy.
 .
 This version is built with pthread support only.  Support for PVM and
 MPI, as well as use of PCL or PAPI for the use of hardware counters,
 and of PDT or DynInst for automatic code instrumentation, are not
 available in packaged form yet.

Description: Tuning and Analysis Utilities - Tcl/tk profiler GUI
 TAU is a profiling toolkit specially made for parallel computing
 (multi-thread, multi-process, MPI, PVM).
 .
 RACY (Routine and data ACces profile displaY) is a GUI that
 graphically visualizes profiling data.
 .
 RACY has been superceded by a set of Java tools, and is no more
 actively developed.  Unfortunately, those tools cannot build yet
 using free tools.
