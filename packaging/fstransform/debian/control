Description: Tool for in-place filesystem conversion
 fstransform is a tool to change a file-system from one format to
 another, for example from jfs/xfs/reiser to ext2/ext3/ext4, in-place
 and without the need for backup. Idea from convertfs, but it is
 fully independent code.
 .
 The current version of fstransform is fully functional, and ready for
 testing from the general public. It has been tested on the following
 file-systems, both as source and target: ext2, ext3, ext4, jfs,
 minix, reiserfs, xfs.
