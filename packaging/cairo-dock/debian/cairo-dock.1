.SH Description
.PP
An light eye\-candy fully themable animated dock for any Linux desktop
This has a family\-likeness with OSX dock, but with more options. Uses
cairo to render nice graphics, and Glitz to use hardware acceleration.
It's fully configurable and can be a taskbar too.  You can easily plug
applets into it.
