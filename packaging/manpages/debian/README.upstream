The following notes refer to Michael Kerrisk as upstream maintainer.

 . Small patches are best sent inline in a mail

 . Use a single mail for each addition and don't add more than one
   update/improvement/addition into one mail.  (Apparently Michael
   uses an mbox as todo list as well)

 . Use diff -u for patches (should be default for all projects anyway)

 . For users: it's best to go through the Debian maintainer to clean
   up the patch before it is sent upstream.
