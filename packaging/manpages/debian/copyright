Manual pages for Debian GNU/Linux
---------------------------------

These manual pages were written by many different people and improved
by probably even more.  Listing all authors and modificators for each
page is not possible.

This package was put together by Martin Schulze <joey@infodrom.org>
from the sources at <http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/docs/man-pages/>.
Its previous maintainers were Martin Schulze and Nicol√°s Lichtmaier.

The online changelog is available at
<http://www.kernel.org/doc/man-pages/changelog.html>
and the current version of the pages is browsable at
<http://www.kernel.org/doc/man-pages/>.

The source of the Debian package is managed using CVS.  It is publicly
available at <http://cvs.infodrom.org/manpages/?cvsroot=debian> or as
<:pserver:anonymous@cvs.infodrom.org/var/cvs/debian/manpages/>.
