  [ Iain Lane ]
  * Update to use my d.o email address

  [ Christopher James Halse Rogers ]

gnome-do-plugins (0.8.3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * It came from the deep! New upstream release
  * debian/rules:
    - Now 100% dfsg-free; drop get-orig-source logic
    - Drop autoreconf-ing; we no longer need to patch the build system.
    - Add “--with” quilt to actually apply the patches.
    - Delete *.addin.xml files on clean; these are autogenerated files which
      shouldn't be in the tarball, and they clutter the debian diff.
    - Upstream buildsystem no longer fails without unused mautil.  Drop it from
      configure.
  * debian/patches/00_debian_default_plugins.patch:
    - Refresh for new upstream version.
  * debian/patches/02_fix_firefox_icon.patch:
    - Drop; fixed in more generality upstream.
  * debian/control:
    - Bump runtime and build-depends on gnome-do to 0.8.4.
    - Add libdbus1.0-cil-dev and libdbus-glib1.0-cil-dev to Build-Depends for
      Empathy plugin.
    - Bump Standards-Version; no changes required.
    - Transition VCS-* fields to git
  * debian/patches/02_gdata_1.7_compatibility.diff:
    - Drop address field from the GMail contacts plugin; this API changed in
      gdata .NET 1.7, and needs fixing upstream

gnome-do-plugins (0.8.2.1+dfsg-2) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Christopher James Halse Rogers ]
  * debian/control:
    + Drop slocate from gnome-do-plugins Recommends: this package is only
      in oldstable (Closes: #565656).
    + Update build-depends for -cil-dev transition.
  * debian/rules:
    + Pass fake MAUTIL=/bin/true to configure.  mautil has moved to the
      mono-addins-utils package, so now isn't pulled in by 
      libmono-addins-cil-dev.  The build system doesn't actually *use* mautil,
      and hasn't for a couple of releases.  Upstream's buildsystem maintainer
      should perhaps pay more attention ;).
  * debian/patches/02_fix_firefox_icon.patch
    + Use the unversioned "firefox" icon name.  Both Iceweasel in Sid and 
      Firefox 3.6 in Lucid ship this icon. (Closes: #544075) (LP: #444171)

  [ Jo Shields ]
  * debian/control:
    + No-change bump to Standards 3.8.4
    + Update mono-devel build-dep to 2.4.3
    + Remove superfluous build-deps on individual mono libs

gnome-do-plugins (0.8.2.1+dfsg-1) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Iain Lane ]
  * New upstream release 0.8.2.1
   - Correctly find Banshee indexer
   - Fix firefox leak on Mono < 2.4 (LP: #381064)
   - Close SSH hosts file after reading
   - Session plugin now works on devicekit-disks (LP: #410079)
  * 02_fix_banshee_plugin.dpatch: Drop, no longer required. Errors will be
    shown on console if Banshee is not installed but these are non-fatal.
  * rules, control: Use mono-csc 
  * debian/rules, debian/*.install: Update dh7isation to be more standard.
    install files no longer required as dh_auto_* takes care of this perfectly
  * debian/rules, debian/control: Use quilt as patchsys - refresh patches to
    take this into account
  * debian/control: Drop gnome-do-plugin-evolution as this cannot be built due
    to our evolution-sharp being uninstallable and unfixable. Sorry. It will
    be back as soon as possible.
  * debian/control: Depend on libflickrnet -dev package as part of the new
    world order

  [ Jo Shields ]
  * debian/rules:
   - Make get-orig-source rule deterministic

gnome-do-plugins (0.8.2+dfsg-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
    + Pidgin plugin now supports initial text for messages (LP: #338608)
    + Pidgin plugin opens conversations on the correct IM network (LP: #370965)
  * debian/rules:
    + Update get-orig-source target.  Upstream no longer ships gdata* binaries,
      so we no longer need to strip them
  * debian/patches/00_use_system_gdata
    + Drop.  Upstream now builds against system libgdata.
  * debian/patches/04_fix_pidgin_dbus_ints
  * debian/patches/10_fix_rhythmbox_file
  * debian/patches/15_twitter_api
  * debian/patches/20_twitter_overflow:
    + Drop.  Included upstream.
  * debian/patches/01_firefox_iceweasel_rename:
    + Refresh for new version
  * debian/patches/02_fix_banshee_plugin:
    + Drop refernce to /usr/lib/banshee-1/Banshee.CollectionIndexer.dll.
      This is unnecessary, and causes errors when Banshee isn't installed.
  * debian/patches/00_debian_default_plugins:
    + Enable a bunch of useful plugins that do not require configuration from 
      the "Official" plugin set by default.  Makes Do more useful out of the 
      box.
  * debian/control:
    + Bump versioned build-dep on gnome-do to 0.8.2
    + Split out gnome-do-plugin-evolution package, now that this is possible.
      libevolution5.0-cil has an annoyingly large dependency stack.
      (LP: #351535) (Closes: #524993).

  * debian/control: Add libgdata1.4-cil build-dep for above.

  * New upstream version
  * debian/control:
    + gnome-sharp2 transition (LP: #314516)
    + Add banshee build-dep
    + Drop monodevelop build-dep; upstream uses mautil rather than mdtool now
    + Bump required gnome-do version in Build-Dep & Depends.
    + Suggest Banshee
  * debian/copyright:

      rather than trying to preserve them.
    + Remove XDG_CONFIG_DIR hack needed for mdtool
    + Make dfsg-stripping more precise.  We now need the BundledLibraries dir
      to build properly
  * debian/patches/00_dfsg_autofoo
    + Update.  Don't remove BundledLibraries entirely, just all the binaries.
      It still needs to copy the system's BansheeCollectionIndexer.dll.
  * debian/patches/01_firefox_iceweasel_rename:

  [ Christopher James Halse Rogers ]
  * New upstream version
  * debian/control
    + Refresh build-depends
    + Don't Suggest amarok, the plugin is no longer built
    + Bump standards-version, adding a README.Source
    + Add conflicts for old Ubuntu packages.  Makes my Ubuntu job easier,
      and apparently some Debian users care too (closes: #486609)
    + Mono 2.0 transition:
      - B-D-I on mono-devel (>= 2.0) rather than mono-gmcs
  * debian/rules
    + Remove --disable-banshee and --disable-amarok from the configure flags.
      These plugins are no longer built upstream.
    + Expand get-orig-source to strip the binary DLLs from the source tarball
    + Run autoreconf after patching to not build plugins dependent on the
      shipped binary libs.
    + Make a copy the original Makefile.in & configure before patching and 
      copy back on clean.
    + Export a temporary XDG_CONFIG_HOME.  The build uses mdtool, which wants 
      to write to $XDG_CONFIG_HOME.
    + Mono 2.0 transition:
      - Call dh build with MCS=/usr/bin/csc
  * debian/patches/00_dfsg_autofoo
    + Remove the plugins that depend on the shipped binaries from the build
  * debian/patches/01_firefox_iceweasel_rename
    + Refresh for new version
  * debian/patches/02_ssh_respect_exec_arg
    + Respect the terminal's "exec" arg set in gconf.  Patch by
      Philipp A. Hartmann.  The rest of the patch is superseded by the new
      upstream version.  (closes: #49777)
  * debian/patches/03_buildsystem_respect_mcs
