.SH NAME
.LP
upnp\-inspector \- Is a UPnP device and service analyzer.

.SH DESCRIPTION
The Inspector is an UPnP Device and Service analyzer, and a debugging tool,
based on the Coherence DLNA/UPnP framework.  Modeled loosely after the Intel
UPnP Device Spy and Device Validator.

The Inspector is a GUI to discover and explorer of UPnP devices on your
network. Detected devices are displayed in a tree\-view, where, amongst other
things, actions can be called and state\-variables be queried.

The Inspector will host the tests from our UPnP test\-suite, to provide a
central place to verify device implementations and hunt down any UPnP
anomalies.

.SH OPTIONS
There are no command line options for upnp\-inspector.
