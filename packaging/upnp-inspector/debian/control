Description: Python UPnP framework analyser
 The Inspector is a Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) Device and Service analyser.
 It is also a debugging tool, based on the Coherence Digital Living Network/
 Universal Plug and Play framework (DLNA/UPnP). The Inspector is a GUI to
 discover and explore UPnP devices on your network. Detected devices are
 displayed in a tree-view, where actions can be called and state-variables may
 be queried.
