Description: file transfer utility for devices that use the OBEX protocol
 OBEX, the OBject EXchange protocol, can best be described as binary HTTP.
 OBEX is optimized for ad-hoc links and can be used to exchange
 all kind of objects like files, pictures, calendar entries (vCal)
 and business cards (vCard) over bluetooth, IrDA, USB and serial cable
 links.
 .
 This is the command line front-end that fully uses the capabilities of
 libobexftp.
