Description: Enlightened Terminal Emulator
 A terminal emulator in the spirit of xterm or rxvt, eterm uses an
 Enlightenment style config file, as well as themes.  The Imlib2 graphics
 engine is used to render images. This version supports background images,
 pixmapped scrollbars, pseudo-transparency, and POSIX threads.
