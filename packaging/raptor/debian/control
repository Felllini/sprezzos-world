Description: Raptor RDF parser and serializer library
 Raptor is a C library providing a set of parsers and serializers for
 Resource Description Framework (RDF) triples by parsing syntaxes or
 serializing the triples into a syntax.
 .
 The parsing syntaxes are RDF/XML, N-Triples, Turtle, GRDDL and RSS
 tag soup including Atom 0.3 and Atom 1.0.  The serializing syntaxes
 are RDF/XML, N-Triples RSS 1.0 and Atom 1.0.  Raptor can handle
 RDF/XML as used by RDF applications such as RSS 1.0, FOAF, DOAP,
 Dublin Core and OWL.
 .
 Raptor is designed for performance, flexibility and embedding (no
 memory leaks) and to closely match the revised RDF/XML specification.
