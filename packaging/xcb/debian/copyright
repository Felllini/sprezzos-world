   * Simple X interface to the cut buffers in an X server.
   * The program creates a window subdivided into a number of subwindows,
   * one per cut buffer.  The user may copy cut buffer contents around
   * using mouse buttons 1 and 2, or rotate the buffers using mouse
   * button 3.  Buffers may be cleared by using Shift-button 2.
   *
   * Note that this program assumes the cut buffers contain textual
   * information, and displays buffer contents using the XDrawString
   * function.  It is not suitable for use in any other environment.
