Description: collection of Last.fm clients and CD-ripping tools
 Ears contains a number of scripts originally distributed with
 lastfmsubmitd for querying MusicBrainz (mbfind, mbget, mbsubmit) and
 using that data to send submissions to Last.fm (lastcd) or rip CDs
 (peel), or both. The unix-pipe design makes it easy to alter data or
 work offline.
 .
 lastfmsubmitd and a Last.fm account are not required; peel functions
 as a perfectly good CD ripper without them. The author welcomes
 contributions of additional scripts utilizing the lastfmsubmitd
 serialization format.
