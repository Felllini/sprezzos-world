Description: Automated wireless attack tool
 Wifite aims to be the "set it and forget it" wireless auditing tool.  
 .
 * sorts targets by signal strength (in dB)
 * cracks closest access points first
 * automatically de-authenticates clients of hidden networks to reveal SSIDs
 * numerous filters to specify exactly what to attack
 * customizable settings (timeouts, packets/sec, etc)
 * "anonymous" feature; changes MAC to a random address before attacking, then changes back when attacks are complete
 * all captured WPA handshakes are backed up to wifite.py's current directory
 * smart WPA de-authentication; cycles between all clients and broadcast deauths
 * stop any attack with Ctrl+C, with options to continue, move onto next target, skip to cracking, or exit
 * displays session summary at exit; shows any cracked keys
 * all passwords saved to cracked.txt
