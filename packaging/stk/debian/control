Description: Sound Synthesis Toolkit (development files)
 The Sound Synthesis Toolkit is a C++ library with implementations
 of several sound synthesis algorithms, starting from Frequency
 Modulation, over Physical Modelling and others. It can be used
 as a library, but it also provides some nice software synthesizers.
 .
 This package provides the development files for the sound synthesis toolkit.
