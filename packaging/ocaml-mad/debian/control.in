Package: libmad-ocaml
Architecture: any
Depends: ${ocaml:Depends}, ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Provides: ${ocaml:Provides}
Description: OCaml bindings for the MAD library (Runtime library)
 This OCaml library interfaces the MAD C library to decode MPEG files.
 The MAD library currently only supports the MPEG 1 standard, but fully
 implements all three audio layers (Layer I, Layer II, and Layer III, the
 latter often colloquially known as MP3.)
 .
 MAD has the following special features:
   - 100% fixed-point (integer) computation
   - completely new implementation based on the ISO/IEC 11172-3 standard
   - distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License (GPL)
 .
 This package contains only the shared runtime stub libraries.
