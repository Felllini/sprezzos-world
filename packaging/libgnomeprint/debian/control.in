Description: GNOME print architecture - runtime files
 The goals of this architecture include:
 .
  * Absolutely uncompromised output quality
  * Speed, memory efficiency, and other related performance goals
  * Ability to work smoothly with Postscript printers, fonts, and other
    resources
  * A screen display derived from the Canvas
  * An extension path for a wide variety of Unicode scripts
  * An extension path for a richer set of graphics operators than Postscript
    supports, especially transparency
  * To make life as easy as possible for application developers
