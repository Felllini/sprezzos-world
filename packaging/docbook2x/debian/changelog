docbook2x (0.8.3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.  Removed all the patches that used to be in
    debian/patches, since they have been applied upstream.
  * debian/control:
    - In Build-Depends, dropped libxml-perl and added libxml-sax-perl.
    - Added Build-Conflicts on libxml2-utils, because the presence of
      /usr/bin/xmllint triggers unecessary buildings in the doc
      directory.
  * debian/rules: Added an extra clean target for files left after building
    the upstream package that are not removed by make clean.  Also, make
    sure that debian/examples is clean.
