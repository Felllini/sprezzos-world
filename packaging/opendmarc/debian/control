Description: Milter implementation of DMARC
 Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting and Conformance (DMARC),
 builds on the successes of technologies such as DomainKeys Identified Mail
 (DKIM) and the Sender Policy Framework (SPF) to create an infrastructure that
 enforces policy on domain names that are visible to end users, and creates a
 feedback framework for identifying and tracking fraudulent use of domain
 names in email.  It uses OpenDBX as an interface layer to various SQL back
 ends.
 .
 It provides the following new capabilities:
 .
 A binding between the domain name seen in the From: field of a message and
 one or both of the domain names verified by DKIM and SPF;
 .
 The capability to request that receivers enforce strict message
 authentication policy published by the author; and Comprehensive reporting,
 both forensic and aggregate, regarding suspect messages.
 .
 This package contains the OpenDMARC mail filter (Milter) for plugging into
 Milter-aware MTAs. It implements support for both message reject and DMARC
 failure reporting.

   - mkdmarc - SQL to create the tables
   - dmarcfail: Parses DMARC forensic reports from Netease (currently the only
     known provider of this report type) and adds them to a MySQL database to
     assist in further analysis.
