libvisual-plugins (0.4.0.dfsg.1-7) unstable; urgency=low

  * QA upload.
  * Mark libvisual-0.4-plugins Multi-Arch: same, since it already ships its
    files in the right place.  This lets the libvisual Recommends be
    satisfied correctly when installing for a foreign arch.  LP: #947639.

libvisual-plugins (0.4.0.dfsg.1-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * QA upload.
  * Ship the alsa.m4 macro in the package since libasound2-dev is linux-only
    and autoreconf will fail on non-linux plattforms otherwise.
    Closes: #647231

libvisual-plugins (0.4.0.dfsg.1-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * QA upload.
  * Build-depend on libvisual-0.4-dev (>= 0.4.0-4) to ensure we install to
    the multiarch path on all architectures.
  * Drop unused build-dependency on chrpath.

libvisual-plugins (0.4.0.dfsg.1-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * QA upload.
  * Various fixes from Ubuntu:
    - Drop build-dependencies on libesd and libjack, neither of which are
      used at runtime.  Closes: #503013.
    - Drop build-dependency on x11proto-core-dev, not used at build time.
    - Build-dep on mesa-common-dev explicitely for GL/glx.h.
    - Add -D_GNU_SOURCE to CFLAGS to pick up mremap prototype. LP: #766045.
    - 60_no-const-vispluginfo-in-nastyfft: the static VisPluginInfo in
      nastyfft was declared as const, but libvisual write to its refcount
      when it visual_object_unref()s it (nasty!).  This is broken at various
      levels: libvisual shouldn't be writing to this static plugin which is
      allocated by a dlopen()ed plugin, and it should also honor the "const
      VisPluginInfo" API...  Anyway, nastyfft was the only occurrence and
      this fixes the crash for now; LP: #287448.
  * Switch from cdbs to dh(1).
  * Switch to debhelper compat 9 for hardening.
  * Use dh_autoreconf to get up-to-date config.guess/config.sub at build
    time, and drop debian/patches/90_autoreconf.patch.  Closes: #503017.
  * Also build-depend on autopoint, not pulled in by dh-autoreconf but needed
    for this package.
  * Update debian/patches/05_fix_po.patch to actually be safe in the face of
    autoreconfing.

libvisual-plugins (0.4.0.dfsg.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
   - builds with gcc-4.x (Closes: #343006)
  * Remove libasound-dev from build dep on KFreeBSD-i386 (Closes: #336855)

libvisual-plugins (0.2.0.dfsg.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New package
   - removed plugins/actor/G-Force directory because it contains
     code that is not DFSG-free.
   - This package does not compile with gcc-4.0, thus the need to
     force an older compiler.  There is C++ code in here, although
     the interface is completely C-based.  Since these are plugins,
     they don't export anything that depends on the C++ ABI, but
     there could theoretically be problems if an application that
     uses a different C++ ABI loads these plugins, thus causing two
     libstdc++ .so's to be loaded simultaneously.
