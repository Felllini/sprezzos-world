Description: command-line tools and docs for the OpenEXR image format
 OpenEXR is a high dynamic-range (HDR) image file format developed by
 Industrial Light & Magic for use in computer imaging applications.
 .
 OpenEXR's features include:
    * Higher dynamic range and colour precision than existing 8- and
      10-bit image file formats.
    * Support for the "half" 16-bit floating-point pixel format.
    * Multiple lossless image compression algorithms. Some of the
      included codecs can achieve 2:1 lossless compression ratios on
      images with film grain.
    * Extensibility. New compression codecs and image types can easily
      be added by extending the C++ classes included in the OpenEXR
      software distribution. New image attributes (strings, vectors,
      integers, etc.) can be added to OpenEXR image headers without
      affecting backward compatibility with existing OpenEXR
      applications.
 .
 This package contains documentation for the format and the following tools:
    * exrheader, a utility for dumping header information.
    * exrstdattr, a utility for modifying OpenEXR standard attributes.
    * exrmaketiled, for generating tiled and rip/mipmapped images.
    * exrenvmap, for creating OpenEXR environment maps.
    * exrmakepreview, for creating preview images for OpenEXR files.
