.SH NAME
codeEditor \- A Python-aware code editor written using the PythonCard GUI framework
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B codeEditor 
[file]
[\fIswitches\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The codeEditor program is one of the tools included with the PythonCard GUI
framework.  It is focused on being a simple to use Python source code editor.
It is not intended to be a generic editor or replace vi(m), Emacs, etc. If you
are already happy with your existing editing environment for Python source
code, there is no particular reason you have to switch. 
.PP
codeEditor borrows ideas and code from IDLE as well as Mark Hammond's
Pythonwin, PyCrust (the PythonCard shell) and Robin Dunn's pyshell.py. The core
editor component uses the wxPython wxStyledTextCtrl (wxSTC) which in turn uses
Neil Hodgson's Scintilla. Isn't open source fun? In 15 minutes you can have a
pretty decent editor by standing on the shoulders of others.

.SH NOTES
.PP
The codeEditor utility also provides additional functionality that is not
discussed in this manpage, because it is somewhat difficult to completely
describe usage of a GUI program in a text-based manpage.  For more detailed
usage instructions or for more information on the PythonCard GUI framework in
general, you should install the pythoncard-doc package and take a look at the
various walk-throughs, tutorials and samples included with it.
.PP
Once the pythoncard-doc package is installed, the documentation is installed to
/usr/share/doc/pythoncard-doc, and is also available via Debian's doc-base
infrastructure - find it in the Devel section using dwww(1), doc-central(1) or
dhelp(1).
.PP
If you would rather not install the pythoncard-doc package, you can find
essentially the same information on the PythonCard website:

.SH BUGS
.PP
Although it is considered to be stable, this is still development-level
software.  If you use codeEditor as a real text editor then you may want to
work on backup copies of documents in case there are bugs that might corrupt
your text.
.PP
Please report bugs in this or any PythonCard component to the Debian Bug
Tracking system using reportbug(1).
