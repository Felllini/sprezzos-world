Description: wxPython-based GUI construction framework (meta-package)
 PythonCard is a GUI construction framework for building cross-platform desktop
 applications on Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux, using the Python language.  It
 is based on the wxPython bindings for the wxWidgets toolkit (formerly known
 as wxWindows).
 .
 This is a meta-package which is intended to be used by developers who want the
 entire upstream distribution available to them.  Maintainers of other packages
 that rely on PythonCard functionality should consider depending on one or more
 of the related packages (python-pythoncard, pythoncard-tools) as needed instead
 of this meta-package.

Description: wxPython-based GUI construction framework (optional development tools)
 PythonCard is a GUI construction framework for building cross-platform desktop
 applications on Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux, using the Python language.  It
 is based on the wxPython bindings for the wxWidgets toolkit (formerly known
 as wxWindows).
 .
 This package takes the tools that are part of the PythonCard distribution
 (such as codeEditor and resourceEditor) and makes them available to be called
 from the command-line and from the standard Debian menus.  It has been split
 out as a separate package since only developers will need access to the tools
 directly - packages which depend on PythonCard will just import the tool
 modules and use what they need.

 associated with the upstream package.
