gthumb for Debian
-----------------

This package uses quilt to manage all modifications to the upstream
source.  Changes are stored in the source package as diffs in
debian/patches and applied during the build.

To read how to properly use quilt, please refer to the official documentation
available at /usr/share/doc/quilt/README.source
