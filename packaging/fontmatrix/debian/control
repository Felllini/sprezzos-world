Description: featureful personal font manager
 fontmatrix is a manager built with the kind of features and abilities
 graphic designers, layout professionals along with others have felt
 necessary, but modernized with some new touches.
 .
 Fontmatrix has a concept of 'tagging'. This makes it really nice to group
 fonts and even sub-group them logically for use in a book for instance.
 It also has extensive gui support for showing all glyphs in a font,
 previews of sample text, variable sizing and also tells what kinds of
 advanced Open Type features are inside each font. These features have
 never been seen outside of a font editor. And not least, it creates a
 nice PDF catalogue of user's fonts for printing or reference. In short,
 fontmatrix is a font manager for professionals, but is nice and user
 friendly.
