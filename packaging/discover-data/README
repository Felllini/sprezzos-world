The Discover package comes with no data of its own.  Data files are
distributed by the Debian project and possibly by others.

This directory contains some sample files and a Perl script to
convert old (e.g., pci.lst) Discover data files to the new
format, and visa versa.

This project is maintained on Alioth,
<URL:https://alioth.debian.org/projects/pkg-discover/>.

To update the list of known PCI devices using the list provided by the
PCI IDs project, <URL: http://pciids.sourceforge.net/ >, run 'make -f
Makefile.update update'.  Updating take a while because the scripts
used are slightly inefficient.
