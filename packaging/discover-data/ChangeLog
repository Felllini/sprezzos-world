	* lst2xml: (CLASSES): Add some new classes.
	
	(USB_CLASSES): Add USB support.

2002-04-29 22:01  epg

	* lst2xml: Whoops, left some debugging cruft in there.

2002-04-29 22:00  epg

	* lst2xml: Move the busclass stuff into a function (make_busclass)
	and move both functions below the CLASSES definitions.	Call
	make_busclass in the loop.

2002-04-29 21:47  epg

	* lst2xml: Move the busclass writing stuff under MAIN; it's going
	to use the new bus_upper variable, which comes from the
	command-line.  Get an uppercase version of the requested bus
	(formerly $hardware_type, now $bus).  Use that and eval to refer to
	the proper hash (for example, PCI_CLASSES).

2002-04-29 21:27  epg

	* lst2xml: s/NEW_CLASSES/PCI_CLASSES/ in preparation for writing
	files for the other busses.

2002-04-29 21:26  epg

	* lst2xml: s/$pciid/$id/ in the busclass section, in preparation
	for writing files for the other bus classes.

2002-04-29 14:58  epg

	* pci-busclass.xml: Regen.

2002-04-29 14:57  epg

	* lst2xml: (NEW_CLASSES): s/network /network/
	
	Also, in the section where we map between the old classes and the
	new, clean up the tests for missing data (it wasn't being
	completely tested and therefore reported errors incorrectly in some
	cases).

2002-04-29 14:17  epg

	* lst2xml: 'ethernet' becomes 'network' in the Brave New XML World.
	 Token-ring adapters and other such devices will also be subsumed
	under this class.

2002-04-29 13:27  branden

	* debian/: changelog, control: added Uploaders: field

	* ChangeLog, debian/changelog: Welcome our friendly new "upstream"
	change log.

2002-04-29 13:21  branden

	* pci.lst: 1106:3058 uses the via82cxxx_audio.o module.  Addresses
	the only part of Debian #119449 that can be addressed by Discover
	1.x.  (The rest of the report is kernel 2.4-specific.)

2002-04-24 15:29  epg

	* pci-device.xml: Regen.

2002-04-24 15:29  epg

	* lst2xml: Alphabetize the attributes of the device elements in
	pci-device.xml.

2002-04-23 13:54  epg

	* pci-vendor.xml: Re-generate.

2002-04-23 13:20  epg

	* pci-busclass.xml, pci-device.xml, pci-vendor.xml: Re-generate.

2002-04-23 13:13  epg

	* lst2xml: Branden and i came to the CLASSES hash and renamed the
	keys to the new names.	Great, but the point of this file is to
	generate new stuff from old, we're dorks :-/.  So move the new
	stuff to NEW_CLASSES.  Generate pci-busclass.xml purely from
	NEW_CLASSES and use both CLASSES and NEW_CLASSES to convert from
	old data to new.
	
	Also go back to using the 'name' attribute in busclass_list and
	vendor_list, just because that's what the parsing code currently
	does.  Really need to make this stuff the contents of the elements
	eventually, IMNSHO.

2002-04-23 10:32  jdaily

	* pci-busclass.xml: Ditch pmc as per epg.

2002-04-19 15:30  epg

2002-04-16 19:12  epg

	data files, generated from the example pci.lst.

2002-04-16 19:00  epg

	* lst2xml: Print opening and closing sections on pci-busclass.xml.
	
	Rename the 'class' attributes of device_list and vendor_list to

	end of each item.
