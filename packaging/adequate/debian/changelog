adequate (0.4) experimental; urgency=low

  * Detect missing versioned symbols, too.
  * Avoid running ldd against the following files:
    - files that are known not to be readable;
    - dynamic linkers;
    - files with whitespace in their names.
  * Filter package names through dpkg-query. This adds or removes architecture
    suffixes, as needed.
  * Reduce number of ldd(1) calls to at most two.

  * Add option for chroot(2)ing into another directory: --root.
  * Add option for switching user and group: --user.
  * Make the APT hook run as user ‘nobody’.

  * Make the package more portable:
    + Stop requiring multi-arch-aware dpkg. Drop versioned runtime dependency
      on dpkg.
    + Stop using IPC::Run. Drop libipc-run-perl recommendation.
    + Load debconf modules lazily.

  * Improve options parsing. Exit with error for incompatible combinations of
    options (e.g. both --pending and --all).
  * Make --help more verbose.

  * Improve the documentation:
    + Work around bug #280148 in pod2man: manual page references should be
      rendered in bold, not in italics.
    + Add a to-do list.
    + Rewrite the undefined-symbol tag description.
    + Don't repeat “Debian Policy” if a tag refers multiple policy sections.
    + Document the --help option.
  * Replace “underlinked libraries” with “undefined symbols” in the package
    description. The latter is what adequate actually detects, while the
    former might or might not be the root cause of the observed problem.
  * Make generating the POD file atomic.
