man2html (1.6g-4) unstable; urgency=low

  The man2html binary package has been recently split into two following parts:

    1. man2html-base    which provides the command-line man to HTML converter
                        and does not depend on any web server stuff;

    2. man2html         which includes the CGI program and obviously requires
                        both the man2html-base and web server (or lynx) to be
                        installed.

  In case you don't need to access your man pages with CGI interface, you can
  safely remove the man2html package, leaving the base part installed only.
