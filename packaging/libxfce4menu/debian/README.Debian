== XDG support

Starting 4.6, Xfce now supports XDG (freedesktop.org) menus, through the
libxfce4menu library. That support is not yet complete, and, for example,
there is no support for the 'Merge' functionnalities. 

The support status can be found on upstream sources, at:
http://svn.xfce.org/svn/xfce/libxfce4menu/tags/xfce_4_6_0/STATUS
