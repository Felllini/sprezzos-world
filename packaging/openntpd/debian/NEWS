openntpd (20080406p-1) experimental; urgency=low

  Dear user,
  .
  By default, fresh openntpd installations will carry this configuration by
  default:
  .
  servers 0.debian.pool.ntp.org
  servers 1.debian.pool.ntp.org
  servers 2.debian.pool.ntp.org
  servers 3.debian.pool.ntp.org
  .
  Since this might be too intrusive to be compulsively added by an upgrade,
  consider adopting them at will.
  Please observe this and some other new features supported on the 
  ntpd.conf(5) manual pages.
