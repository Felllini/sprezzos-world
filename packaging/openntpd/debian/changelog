openntpd (3.6.1p1-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Change E-mail address to kurt@roeckx.be
  * poll_errors.dpatch: When poll() says there was an error on a socket, it
    didn't get checked and on the next poll() call got the same error again
    resulting in cpuhog. Patch from upstream CVS. (Closes: #307348)
  * Add a Depends on adduser since we use it in the postinst/postrm.
  * Use set -e in postinst/postrm instead of doing /bin/sh -e.
  * Create a defaults file, and mention the -s option in it.
  * freeifaddrs.dpatch: Call freeifaddrs() with the proper pointer.  Patch
    from upstream CVS.
  * imsg_memmove.dpatch: Use a memmove() instead of memcpy() as those buffers
    might overlap.  Patch from upstream CVS.
  * network_unreachable.dpatch: Do not consider ENETUNREACH as a fatal error.
    Patch from upstream CVS.
  * daemonize_settime.dpatch: When started with -s option (which isn't used by
    default) daemonize if sending failed instead of waiting for a reply.  This
    might be a problem when the network is down.  Patch from upstream CVS.
  * Remove the reload option from the init.d script since sending a SIGHUP
    does not work.  It just sets a flag and does nothing with that.
