Description: metapackage for the BOINC client and the manager
 The Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing (BOINC) is a
 software platform for distributed computing: several initiatives of
 various scientific disciplines all compete for the idle time of
 desktop computers. The developers' web site at the University of
 Berkeley serves as a common portal to the otherwise independently run
 projects.
 .
 This package depends both on the BOINC core client program that is
 required to participate in any project that uses BOINC, and the
 BOINC Manager, a graphical monitor and control utility for the
 BOINC core client.

Description: libraries of BOINC the client depends on
 The Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing (BOINC) is a
 software platform for distributed computing using volunteered computer
 resources.
 .
 The environment offers a series of libraries that both the user-run
 client and the client-invoked scientific applications depend on. With
 the number of cores per machine growing, and with scientific apps
 commonly started for every core, it is essential to have memory
 shared as much as possible between binaries of all projects.

 Regular users (rightously) often find it an unbearable nuissance to
 care for the exact configuration of BOINC for CUDA-savvy graphics
 cards. This package adds a series of dependencies from the non-free
 section to the regular boinc package. This also meant this binary
 package to be redistributed in the contrib section of Debian.

 graphics cards.  This package adds a series of dependencies from the
 non-free section to the regular boinc package. This also meant this
 binary package to be redistributed in the contrib section of Debian.
 .
 This package is not perfect, yet. A major problem for the moment
 is the availability of the OpenCL driver for 32bit binaries for
 amd64. If this is planned, install the amd-app package provided
 through the AMD developer forum.

Description: core client for the BOINC distributed computing infrastructure
 The Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing (BOINC) is a
 software platform for distributed computing: several initiatives of
 various scientific disciplines all compete for the idle time of
 desktop computers. The developers' web site at the University of
 Berkeley serves as a common portal to the otherwise independently run

 .
 This package contains the BOINC core client program that is required
 to participate in any project that uses BOINC. A central server
 distributes work units and collects results via this client. When
 attaching a local machine to a project, this client will also
 dynamically download the scientific data and executables to be then
 wrapped by the BOINC core client.

# The Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing (BOINC) is a
# software platform for distributed computing: several initiatives of
# various scientific disciplines all compete for the idle time of
# desktop computers. The developers' web site at the University of
# Berkeley serves as a common portal to the otherwise independently run

# .
# The BOINC client is configurable by the command line or the BOINC
# manager's GUI to compute with any range between 0% and 100% of
# available resources, and to change that ratio to a higher after
# some user determined duration of inactivity. There is now quite
# a number of individuals who prefer to have everything presented
# with their accustomed priciple for setting and choosing a screen
# saver. Upon inactivity, the BOINC client is started, and stopped
# again when the user is back. To save the screen, it then shows
# the graphical progress indication as optionally shown also by
# the manager.
# .
# This package is excellent to further promote BOINC, recalling the
# effect SETI@Home once had in the Cambridge, UK, CB2 Cybercafe.
# Just, when using it together with the regular BOINC client setup,
# it is suggested not to have all CPUs used to avoid multiple
# processes running on the same core.

Description: GUI to control and monitor the BOINC core client
 The Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing (BOINC) is a
 software platform for distributed computing using volunteered computer
 resources.
 .
 This package contains the BOINC Manager, a graphical monitor and
 control utility for the BOINC core client. It gives a detailed
 overview of the state of the client it is monitoring, as there are
  * attached projects
  * running tasks
  * file transfers between the client and project servers
  * statistics about granted credits and disk usage for every project
  * constraints on CPU usage
 The BOINC Manager has two modes of operation, the "Simple View" in which
 it only displays the most important information and the "Advanced View"
 in which all information and all control elements are available.
 .
 For active participation in any BOINC project the recommended
 boinc-client package, not the boinc-manager, is required for every
 machine contributing.

 with names in a debugger, this makes it somewhat easier to interpret
 core dumps.
