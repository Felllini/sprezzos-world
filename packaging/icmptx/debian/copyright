    The code for the ICMP handling was originally included from the
    itunnel program. Tun interface handling was included from the
    VTun project, originally authored by Maxim Krasnyansky. The two
    were brought together by edi / teso. From there, Siim PÃµder cleaned
    up the code and wrote a short article about it. That seems to be how
    Thomer Gil found it, after which he further cleaned it up and presented
    it at http://thomer.com/icmptx/, which is where John Plaxco came across it.
    Further and newer information may be available at the project's homepage.
