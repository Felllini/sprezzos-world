.SH "NAME"
libopenms \- library for LC/MS data management and analysis

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This manual page documents briefly the \fBlibopenms\fR package that
brings a library for LC/MS data management and analysis. OpenMS offers
an infrastructure for the development of mass spectrometry-related
software and powerful 2D and 3D visualization solutions. OpenMS offers
analyses for various quantitation protocols, including label-free
quantitation, SILAC, iTRAQ, SRM, SWATH… It provides build-in
algorithms for de-novo identification and database search, as well as
adapters to other state-of-the art tools like X!Tandem, Mascot, OMSSA…
OpenMS supports the Proteomics Standard Initiative (PSI) formats for
MS data and supports easy integration of tools into workflow engines
like Knime, Galaxy, WS-Pgrade, and TOPPAS via the TOPPtools concept
and a unified parameter handling.
