Description: library for LC/MS data management and analysis - runtime
 OpenMS is a library for LC/MS data management and analysis. OpenMS
 offers an infrastructure for the development of mass
 spectrometry-related software and powerful 2D and 3D visualization
 solutions.
 .
 OpenMS offers analyses for various quantitation protocols, including
 label-free quantitation, SILAC, iTRAQ, SRM, SWATH…
 .
 It provides built-in algorithms for de-novo identification and
 database search, as well as adapters to other state-of-the art tools
 like X!Tandem, Mascot, OMSSA…
 .
 OpenMS supports the Proteomics Standard Initiative (PSI) formats for
 MS data and supports easy integration of tools into workflow engines
 like Knime, Galaxy, WS-Pgrade, and TOPPAS via the TOPPtools concept
 and a unified parameter handling.

Description: set of programs implementing The OpenMS Proteomic Pipeline
 TOPP (the OpenMS proteomic pipeline) is a pipeline for the analysis
 of HPLC/MS data. It consists of a set of numerous small applications
 that can be chained together to create analysis pipelines tailored
 for a specific problem. The applications make use of the libopenms
 library. Some examples of these applications are :
 .
   - TOPPView: A viewer for mass spectrometry data.
   - TOPPAS: An assistant for GUI-driven TOPP workflow design.
   - DTAExtractor: Extracts spectra of an MS run file to several
     files in DTA format.
   - FileConverter:  Converts between different MS file formats.
   - FileFilter: Extracts or manipulates portions of data from peak,
     feature or consensus feature files.
   - SpectraMerger: Merges spectra from an LC/MS map, either by
     precursor or by RT blocks.
   - BaselineFilter: Removes the baseline from profile spectra using a
     top-hat filter.
   - InternalCalibration: Applies an internal calibration.
   - PTModel: Trains a model for the prediction of proteotypic
     peptides from a training set.
   - RTPredict: Predicts retention times for peptides using a model 
     trained by RTModel.
   - ExecutePipeline: Executes workflows created by TOPPAS.
