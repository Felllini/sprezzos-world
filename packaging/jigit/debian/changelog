jigit (1.19-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
    + Improved error-handling in mkimage and libjte.
      - mkjigsnap rewrite:
      - merge two old implementations
      - switch to perl: cleaner code, much faster snapshot generation
      - added -v (verbose) and -N (dry-run) options
    + Put AC_CONFIG_MACRO_DIR in a better place in the libjte configure
      script.
    + Remove -Werror from the Makefile - gcc is getting more and more
      pedantic with every release, and this may cause package builds to
      fail.
  * Removed the jigit script itself - it hasn't worked in ages, and just
    doesn't seem to be useful any more. Closes: #506449
