acetoneiso (2.3-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/control:
    - Drop the libqt4-dev (<< 4:4.7.0~beta2) in build dependencies. Not needed
      any more because libqt4-dev is already updated (Closes: #655616) [Thanks
      to Peter Green]
    - Replace libqt4-webkit dependency with libqtwebkit4, since the former is
      by now just a transitional package; automatically done by dpkg-shlibdeps
      (Closes: #639783)
    - Bumped standards version to 3.9.2
  * debian/changelog:
    - corrected spelling of "MS" [Thanks to Jonathan Nieder]
