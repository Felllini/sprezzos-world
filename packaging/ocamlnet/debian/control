Description: OCaml application-level Internet libraries - core development libraries
 Ocamlnet is a collection of OCaml libraries focusing focus on
 application-level Internet protocols and conventions.
 .
 Ocamlnet consists of the following libraries:
  * netstring: processing of strings that occur in network context
  * netcgi1 and netcgi2: portable web applications
  * nethttpd: is a web server component (HTTP server implementation)
  * netplex: generic server framework
  * rpc: OncRPC implementation
  * netclient: clients for HTTP, FTP, and Telnet
  * equeue: event queue used for many protocol implementations
  * shell: external commands invocation
  * netshm: shared memory for IPC purposes
  * netsys: bindings for system functions
  * smtp and pop: two further client implementations
 .
 A number of ideas and concepts are used throughout the libraries:
  * netchannels are a way to abstract sequential I/O channels
  * event queues provided by equeue and unixqueue make asynchronous
    protocol interpreters possible
 .
 This package contains the development stuff you need to use the core
 Ocamlnet libraries in your programs. The following libraries are
 packaged separately: SSL-related libraries (libocamlnet-ssl-ocaml-dev),
 GTK-related libraries (libocamlnet-gtk2-ocaml-dev), nethttpd
 (libnethttpd-ocaml-dev). The netcgi2 Apache connector is also part of
 this package; to run applications built for that connector you will
 need the mod_netcgi_apache Apache module (libapache2-mod-ocamlnet).
