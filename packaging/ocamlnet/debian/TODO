- building without invoking "clean" doesn't work
  (to test: "fakeroot debian/rules binary" fails---as probably "debuild binary"
  will--- while debuild works)

- manpages for /usr/bin/ocamlrpcgen and /usr/bin/netplex-admin. The latter is
  almost entirely available in the HTML doc, the former can probably be
  generated with help2man (but I would like to have both of them either in
  docbook or directly from upstream who can probably automatically generate
  them)
  Update: ocamlrpcgen has a manpage written by Thomas Petazzoni and available
  in the old librpc-ocaml-dev package, reuse it!

- switch packaging workflow to GIT + TopGit
