powerman for Debian
-------------------

This package allows Power Distribution Unit (PDU) management in two ways:
- directly, by only using the present powerman package,
- or in a more "standard" and overall way throug the nut and nut-powerman
packages. Note that NUT has a broader Power Devices scope, and also currently
manages UPSs.

Either ways, you will obviously need to configure Powerman yourself!
