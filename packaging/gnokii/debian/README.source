DFSG status:
------------

The file utils/gnapplet.sis has been removed from the source due to not
having the source code included and being a cross-compiled binary specific
for Symbian OSs.
Symbian users interested in installing it on their phones should get it at:
http://www.gnokii.org/download/gnapplet/

The gnokii.nol binary in the docs dir is only a Nokia Operator Logo file,
and therefore shouldn't need sources.
