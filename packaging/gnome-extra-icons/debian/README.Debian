gnome-extra-icons for Debian
----------------------------

This package includes a lot of icons that can be used by GNOME Desktop, as well
by other desktop enviromnents. These icons were collected by Marcus Crafter
from the old address http://art.gnome.org/icons.php in 2002.

If you find any other icons you think should be included, please let me
know.
