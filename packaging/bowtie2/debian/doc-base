Abstract: ultrafast memory-efficient short read aligner
 is an ultrafast and memory-efficient tool for aligning sequencing reads to 
 long reference sequences. It is particularly good at aligning reads of about 
 50 up to 100s or 1,000s of characters, and particularly good at aligning to 
 relatively long (e.g. mammalian) genomes. Bowtie 2 indexes the genome with 
 an FM Index to keep its memory footprint small: for the human genome, 
 its memory footprint is typically around 3.2 GB. 
 Bowtie 2 supports gapped, local, and paired-end alignment modes.
