yum (3.2.25-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * 'module'
  object has no attribute 'uses_fragment' (Closes: #679067).
  * Using zigo@debian.org as maintainer email.

yum (3.2.25-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.
  * Not using the yumpackage@gplhost.com, but my "normal" email address again
    as maintainer address, as my employee Manuel is no longer willing to help,
    as he resigned from his position at GPLHost.
  * Removed patches that are no longer needed thanks to my work with upstream:
    - yum.conf.5 has been corrected thanks to a patch I sent to upstream, so
    a patch in Debian is no longer needed, same for the yum.8 man page.
    - python-iniparse has been uploaded to SID, so a patch to not use it is as
    well not needed anymore.
    - python-gpgme is now in SID.
    - The version of logrotate in SID now supports yearly rotating, so a
    patch is no longer needed as well.
    All together, the number of patches needed for Yum is reduced to only 1,
    making it A WAY more easy to maintain.
  * Changed dependency from just python-celementtree to python (>= 2.5) |
    python-celementtree as python-celementtree is now part of python2.5, and
    that python2.4 is to be removed from SID (Closes: #562455).
  * Bumped Standards-Version.
  * Reworked a bit the debian/copyright so it's more accurate.
  * Reworked the debian/README.Debian, wrote a debian/source.
  * Switched from Required to Should in the debian/yum-updatesd.init, added
    a $local_fs as Should also, and did some tiny cleanups in debian/rules.

yum (3.2.23-1) unstable; urgency=low

yum (3.2.21-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Moved python-dev, python-support and intltool to Build-Depends-Indep:
  * Added a Homepage: field and a watch file
  * Added mechanismes in debian/rules to preserve po/yum.pot that is created
    each time by the build process (the .diff.gz was big for nothing, this is
    better now).
  * Added a patch so that etc/yum.logrotate uses monthly as logrotate option,
    as we received cron emails from some of our servers in production, warning
    that yearly is not a valid option for logrotate. The cron job for
    logrotate should be more quite now.
  * Now depending on debhelper >= 5.
  * Bumped StandardVersion to 3.8.1.

yum (3.2.21-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Adopting package. Former maintainer retired from Debian recently, and
    co-maintainer expressed he had no further interest in yum in
    http://lists.debian.org/debian-release/2009/02/msg00413.html.
    I (Thomas Goirand) will be co-maintaining this package with my employee
    Manuel Amador: I feel comfortable with Debian packaging, while Manuel is
    a python and RPM system specialist. The maintainer email address of this
    package (signed with my Debian GPG key) forwards to both of us.
  * New upstream release
  * Added Dm-Upload-Allowed: yes field.
  * Forward-ported documentation, sqlite and Makefile patch from last Debian
    package in Lenny, added build-dep dpatch (patches are now separate and not
    generated in the diff.gz which I think is ugly packaging).
  * Removed upstream dependency on python-iniparse and patched to be able to
    work without it as python-iniparse is not in Debian (yet).
  * Removed Debian dependency on python-pyme (which is a mistake of the last
    NMU that thought it was the same as python-gpgme), removed upstream
    dependency on python-gpgme, patched to work without it (Closes: #496137).
  * Note: this is only a temporary package before we can have python-gpgme,
    and python-iniparse inside Debian. This package version aims at a qa upload
    to fix the current situation in Lenny where the yum package is broken
    because it is trying to call a python module that doesn't exists in Lenny
    (see src/misc.py and our patch for it). It seems that 2 other maintainers
    have already started working on packaging python-gpgme and python-iniparse.
