Package: libball1.4-data
Section: science
Architecture: all
Depends: ${misc:Depends}
Description: Biochemical Algorithms Library
 BALL (Biochemical Algorithms Library) is an application framework 
 in C++ that has been specifically designed for rapid software 
 development in Molecular Modeling and Computational Molecular Biology. 
 It provides an extensive set of data structures as well as classes 
 for Molecular Mechanics, advanced solvation methods, comparison and 
 analysis of protein structures, file import/export, and visualization.
 BALL is currently being developed in the groups of Oliver Kohlbacher
 (University of Tuebingen, Germany), Andreas Hildebrandt (Saarland 
 University, Saarbruecken, Germany), and Hans-Peter Lenhof (Saarland 
 University, Saarbruecken, Germany).
 .
 This package contains the data files (force field parameters, fragment
 data bases, etc) necessary for using BALL.

Description: free molecular modeling and molecular graphics tool
 BALLView provides fast OpenGL-based visualization of molecular structures, 
 molecular mechanics methods (minimization, MD simulation using the 
 AMBER, CHARMM, and MMFF94 force fields), calculation and visualization 
 of electrostatic properties (FDPB) and molecular editing features.
 .
 BALLView can be considered a graphical user interface on the basis of
 BALL (Biochemical Algorithms Library) with a focus on the most common
 demands of protein chemists and biophysicists in particular.  It is
 developed in the groups of Hans-Peter Lenhof (Saarland University,
 Saarbruecken, Germany) and Oliver Kohlbacher (University of Tuebingen,
 Germany). BALL is an application framework in C++ that has been
 specifically designed for rapid software development in Molecular
 Modeling and Computational Molecular Biology.  It provides an extensive

Description: debug symbols for BALL and VIEW libraries
 BALL (Biochemical Algorithms Library) is an application framework 
 in C++ that has been specifically designed for rapid software 
 development in Molecular Modeling and Computational Molecular Biology. 
 The package comprises an extensive manual on how to program molecular
 modelling programs with BALL.
 .
 This package contains all the extra information on the libraries of
 BALL, BALLView and the Python wrappers to help debuggers like GDB to
 interpret a core dump. This is tremendously useful for debugging and
 maybe even more so for the communication between the user of this
 package and upstream when something goes wrong.
