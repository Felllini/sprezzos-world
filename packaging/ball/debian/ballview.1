.SH NAME
BALLView - A free molecular modeling and molecular graphics tool
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B BALLView
.RI [Molecular-file]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B BALLView
BALLView provides fast OpenGL-based visualization of molecular structures,
molecular mechanics methods (minimization, MD simulation using the
AMBER and CHARMM force fields), calculation and visualization
of electrostatic properties (FDPB).
.P
BALLView is based on BALL (Biochemical Algorithms Library) ,
which is currently being developed in the groups of Oliver Kohlbacher
(University of Tuebingen, Germany), Andreas Hildebrandt (Saarland 
University, Saarbruecken, Germany), and Hans-Peter Lenhof (Saarland 
University, Saarbruecken, Germany). BALL is an application framework 
in C++ that has been specifically designed for rapid software
development in Molecular Modeling and Computational Molecular Biology.
It provides an extensive set of data structures as well as classes
for Molecular Mechanics, advanced solvation methods, comparison and
analysis of protein structures, file import/export, and visualization.
.P
BALLView is available under the LGPL licence.
