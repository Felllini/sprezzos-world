+with points in different parts separated by a plus

+.SH NAME
+shprewind \- fix polygon ring orientations in ESRI shapefiles
+.SH SYNOPSIS
+.B shprewind
+.I infile outfile
+.SH DESCRIPTION
+Makes a copy of the shapefile
+.I infile
+to 
+.I outfile
+and fixes the orientation of points in the rings of
+.BR Polygon ", " PolygonZ ", and " PolygonM
+typed shapes to conform to the shapefile specification.  According to the
+specification, the vertices of outer rings should be oriented
+clockwise on the
+.I X/Y
+plane, and those of inner rings counterclockwise.
+
+Shapefiles actually consist of two files with the same basename and
+extensions
+.BR .shp \ and\  .shx " (or " .SHP \ and\  .SHX ") "
+containing the shape data and shape index respectively.  The files
+to open are determined by first stripping any filename extension
+from
+.I infile 
+and attempting to open the files
+.IB infile .shp
+or 
+.IB infile .SHP,
+and
+.IB infile .shx
+or
+.IB infile .SHX
+for the respective data and index files.  The files to create
+from
+.I outfile
+are determined by stripping any filename extension from
+.I outfile
+and appending
+.B .shp
+and
+.B .shx
+suffixes for the respective data and index files.

+.SH BUGS
+The implementation assumes that there is at most one outer ring in
+each shape, that it is the first ring in a shape, and all other
+rings in a shape are inner rings.  Polygons inside
+.B MultiPatch
+shape types aren't rewound.
