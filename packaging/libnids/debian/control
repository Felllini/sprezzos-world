Description: IP defragmentation TCP segment reassembly library (development)
 Libnids is a library that provides the functionality of one of the NIDS
 (Network Intrusion Detection System) components, namely E-component. 
 Libnids code watches all local network traffic, cooks received datagrams a 
 bit, and provides convenient information about them to the NIDS analyzing 
 modules.
 Libnids performs assembly of TCP segments into TCP streams, IP 
 defragmentation, and TCP port scan detection.
