    themselves.

    - Set hardening flags through the DEB_BUILD_MAINT_OPTIONS variable,
      exported it and included buildflags.mk in d.rules.

  * Enable installation of multiarch binaries :
    - Added Pre-Depends: ${misc:Pre-Depends} for the libfko package in
      d.control.
    - Replaced occurrences of /usr/lib/ in debian/*.install with /usr/lib/*/.

    [access|fwknopd].conf.inst. We revert upstream changes with an overwrite
    on dh_install.
