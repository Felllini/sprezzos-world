Description: Python UPnP framework
 Coherence is a framework written in Python enabling your application to
 participate in digital living networks, at the moment primarily the
 UPnP universe.
 .
 Its goal is to relieve your application from all the membership / the
 UPnP related tasks as much as possible.
 .
 The core of Coherence provides a (hopefully complete) implementation
 of:
  * a SSDP server,
  * a MSEARCH client,
  * server and client for HTTP/SOAP requests, and
  * server and client for Event Subscription and Notification (GENA).
