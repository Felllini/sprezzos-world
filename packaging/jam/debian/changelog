jam (2.5rel-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Final 2.5 release - using this version string to compensate for the
    mistake about rc2 (see below).  
  * Had to use previous version of jam to refresh generated files, since
    bootstrapping jam0 failed.  
  * Bumped Standards-Version to 3.6.1, no change.
  * Removed the call to "./jam0 clean" from clean rules, since it removes
    files necessary to bottstrap the build.

jam (2.4-2) unstable; urgency=medium

    rules.  Includes a more thorough set of rules for (La)TeX documents.
