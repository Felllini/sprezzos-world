k3d (0.8.0.2-18) unstable; urgency=low

  * Build-Depend on libtiff-dev after all, since it seems that using
    libtiff5-dev in wheezy is discouraged, and the build-depends were causing
    loops in buildds when trying to resolve dependencies (Closes: #676786).
    Thanks Aurelien Jarno and Julien Cristau for the report and the advice.

k3d (0.8.0.2-17) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix dependency on ttf-bitstream-vera, the data package was symlinking to
    files contained in it without depending on it
  * Build-depend on (libtiff5-dev | libtiff4-dev) (instead of only version 4)
  * Move lintian override no-upstream-changelog from source to binary packages,
    it doesn't belong in sources

k3d (0.8.0.2-16) unstable; urgency=low

  * Bump Policy Standards-Version to 3.9.3 (no changes needed)
  * Update Build-Depends debhelper to >=9~ instead of 8.9.0~ (quells lintian
    warning package-needs-versioned-debhelper-build-depends)
  * Move lintian override no-upstream-changelog from k3d binary package to
    source
  * Add patch ftbfs-gcc47.patch to fix a FTBFS with GCC-4.7 (Closes: #672627)

k3d (0.8.0.2-14) unstable; urgency=low

  * Not modifying CXXFLAGS or anything related with DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS, removing
    from 'rules'

k3d (0.8.0.2-13) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix FTBFS when providing more than one element in CXXFLAGS
    (Closes: #646274), thanks Julian Taylor for reporting
  * Removed Vcs-Hg and Vcs-Browser in "control" file, they point to
    upstream and not the Debian packaging
  * Quell lintian:
    - desktop-entry-contains-encoding-key: Removed Encoding line from
      k3d.desktop, it's unnecessary/deprecated
    - unneeded-build-dep-on-quilt: Removed Build-Depends on quilt
    - no-upstream-changelog: Upstream doesn't provide any, override
      lintian warning
    - no-symbols-control-file: the dynamic objects in this package are
      not used as a shared library, but as internal program
      addons/plugins, they don't need versioning, override lintian
      warning

k3d (0.8.0.2-12) unstable; urgency=low

  * Remove from debian/rules the special handling of "CXXFLAGS +=
  -ffunction-sections -mlong-calls" for HPPA architecture, for several reasons:
  it never really worked, HPPA is in debian-ports now (so lesser importance),
  k3d is not a suitable package for HPPA machines anyway (it's for modern
  desktops), and it hasn't been installable for a while (due to important
  missing dependencies, such as cmake).

k3d (0.8.0.2-11) unstable; urgency=low

  * Remove "Build-Depends libinotifytools-dev [linux-any]", it's not needed
    really -- only <sys/inotify.h> is needed
  * Modify debian/rules to include "/usr/include/MULTIARCH_DIR" when searching
    for inotify, otherwise the simple method to search for the availability of
    the library does not work.

 -- Manuel A. Fernandez Montecelo <manuel.montezelo@gmail.com>  Sun, 21 Aug 2011 13:38:58 +0100

k3d (0.8.0.2-10) unstable; urgency=low

  * Using "Build-Depends libinotifytools-dev [linux-any]", instead of excluding
    "hurd-*" and "kfreebsd-*" architectures.  This was already tried in
    0.8.0.2-4, but at the time the automatic build infrastructure didn't support
    it.  (Closes: #634665).

k3d (0.8.0.2-9) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add '--remove-section=.note' when stripping *.module files
  * Changed debhelper compat to level 8 (level 7 before), no changes needed
  * Build-Depends on libjpeg-dev instead of libjpeg62-dev
  * Overriding lintian errors of embedded libraries while waiting for a reply
    from upstream, it's not straightforward to unravel:
    - 'embedded-library usr/lib/libk3dsdk-ftgl.so.1: ftgl'
    - 'embedded-library usr/lib/libk3dsdk-glew.so.1: glew'

k3d (0.8.0.2-8) unstable; urgency=low

  * Rebuild for imagemagick4 transition (Closes: #625576)
  * Bump Standards-Version to 3.9.2 (no changes needed)
  * Simplifying a lot debian/rules file by leveraging debhelper capabilities,
    only acting when deviating from auto behaviour

 -- Manuel A. Fernandez Montecelo <manuel.montezelo@gmail.com>  Sat, 28 May 2011 03:21:18 +0200

k3d (0.8.0.2-7) unstable; urgency=low

  * Remove build dependency on libopencascade-dev, since the opencascade module
    uses k3d::gprim_factory which has been removed, and thus it's not enabled at
    build time anyway (Closes: #616668).  Thanks Denis Barbier for the heads-up.
  * Seems to build fine on GCC-4.5 (Closes: #565008), default compiler on
    unstable at this time (on most architectures, anyway).  The problem was most
    likely occuring in libsigc++-2.0 for some reason, and has been fixed since
    then.

  * Adding .desktop file so it appears in menus

k3d (0.8.0.2-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Using "dh_shlibdeps -a -- debian/k3d/usr/lib/k3d/plugins/*.module" to have
    shared lib dependencies right, so the module TimeSource (and others) do not
    fail to load when the program starts (Closes: #609200).  Thanks to Paul Wise
    <pabs@d.o> for the tip.
  * Change Build-Depends to depend on Boost >= 1.42 (were ">> 1.42" before,
    which do not exist, but were pulled in somehow, maybe by other dependencies)

 -- Manuel A. Fernandez Montecelo <manuel.montezelo@gmail.com>  Fri, 07 Jan 2011 12:31:08 +0100

k3d (0.8.0.2-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Make libinotifytools-dev conditional with [!kfreebsd-i386 !kfreebsd-amd64
  !hurd-i386], it's not available in these architectures and [linux-any] does
  not work (Closes: #592532)

 -- Manuel A. Fernandez Montecelo <manuel.montezelo@gmail.com>  Fri, 13 Aug 2010 00:12:37 +0200

k3d (0.8.0.2-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Bump Standards-Version to 3.9.1 (no changes needed)
  * Use Breaks and Replaces to allow for smooth upgrades without errors,
    caused by files from one package overriding others (Closes: #588604)
  * Change the package to priority "extra", optional is for "all the
    software that you might reasonably want to install if you didn't
    know what it was and don't have specialized requirements".  This is
    not the case, and additionally debcheck reports that it depends on
    software with "extra" priority (libxcb-render-util0), which should
    not happen.
  * Use -mlong-calls in addition to -ffunction-sections in HPPA,
    hopefully this time it will work fine (Closes: #588923)
  * Quell lintian:
    - quilt-patch-missing-description (bug_554930-ftbfs-gold.patch)
    - duplicate-short-description (k3d k3d-data)

k3d (0.8.0.2-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Put myself in the Uploaders field, add DM-Upload-Allowed: yes
  * Added patch for FTBFS with binutils-gold (Closes: #554930)
  * Use Breaks instead of Conflicts (lintian: conflicts-with-version)
  * Create k3d-data binary package (lintian: arch-dep-package-has-big-usr-share)
  * Added --remove-section=.comment when stripping by hand (lintian:
    binary-has-unneeded-section)
  * Use special "CXXFLAGS += -ffunction-sections" on hppa architecture,
    otherwise the build fails at 17% (let's hope there're no more errors...).

k3d (0.8.0.2-1.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Non-maintainer upload.
  * New upstream release (Closes: #581590).
    - Probably fixed the important bug during the 3 years since last
      release (Closes: #443684).
  * Updated man pages with 'help2man -N --no-discard-stderr"
  * Changed debhelper compat to level 7
  * Added 'watch' file
  * Added 'source/format', with '3.0 (quilt)'
  * Bump Standards-Version to 3.9.0
  * Quelling lintian warnings:
    - out-of-date-standards-version 3.8.0
    - package-uses-deprecated-debhelper-compat-version 4
    - patch-system-but-no-source-readme (now format 3.0 quilt)

    - debhelper-but-no-misc-depends (added)
    - binary-without-manpage (added manpages)
    - duplicate-font-file (depend on ttf-bitstream-vera and symlink)
  * Dropped all patches:
    * applied upstream:
      - 03_desktop_file_compliant.patch
      - 08_sigc++_headers.patch
    * uses CMake instead of autotools, not applicable anymore:

k3d (0.6.7.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * This package is dedicated to the countless Ubuntu developers that do not
    report any bug back to Debian.  Thanks, you make life less pleasant.
  * New upstream release:
    - First iteration of the new animation output dialog.
    - Replaced boost::filesystem::path with k3d::filesystem::path.
    - Created k3d::ustring for working with UTF-8 text.
    - Replaced k3d::frames with k3d::file_range.
    - Removed obsolete POV render engine plugin.

    - Better scrolling for the NGUI console control.
  * debian/control:
    - Removed libboost-filesystem-dev from Build-Depends.
    - Replaced old ${Source-Version} with ${binary:Version}.
    - Finally moved local patches to quilt, so we Build-Depend on it.
  * debian/rules:
    - Fixed stupidly compressed tutorial (share/tutorials/gts_boolean.py)
      without proper extension, thus dropping a warning in the installation.
    - Fixed a lintian error about ignoring errors in distclean target.
  * debian/patches/02_boost-mt_libs.patch: Patched configure to point to
    -lboost_*-mt instead of lboost_*.  Closes: #425893.
  * debian/patches/05_gcc4.3_build.patch: Added a fix for GCC 4.3 builds.

k3d (0.6.5.0.ds1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.  List of main changes follows:
    - FrozenMesh, K3DMeshInput, and OBJMeshInput plugins have a "reset" button
      in the Node Properties Panel that forces an update.
    - Directed graph loop-detection code didn't work in all cases.
    - Python tutorials weren't getting installed.
    - Revert inadvertent change to the code::blocks build
    - Synchronize code::blocks build.
    - The switch to shared mesh instance archives broke automatic RenderMan
      shader compilation.
    - File > Revert command didn't update the UI layer correctly.
    - Merged fix from Debian for compile error in
      modules/quadrilateral_remeshing/quadrilateral_remeshing.cpp.
  * Pulled patch from Ubuntu packages in order to use .desktop file provided
    in the package and modified to make it standards-compliant.  Thanks,
    Adri2000.
  * debian/rules: Added --list-missing to dh_install.  Let's see if I am
    missing any other thing.

k3d (0.6.4.0.ds1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.  Main changes are:
    - Reduce output RIB file size.

    - Safe Close Dialog did not correctly treat the escape key as a "cancel" operation.
    - Fixed several compile-time problems.

    - Enhanced installer.
    - Cleanup and organize sample documents.
    - Added control over Axes plugin colors

k3d (0.6.0.0.ds1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.  Final stable release.  Main changes since 0.5.12.0:
    - Enhanced tutorials, and added new ones.
    - Fixes for gcc 4.1.1 builds.
    - Code cleanup and lots of bugfixes.
    - Updated rasterization of SVG icons.
    - Remove debug output
    - Better startup messages.
    - Fix QTUI build.
  * I do not know why upstream let all the Makefiles and other cruft behind in
    the tarball, but after running a manual make distclean, the orig.tar.gz is
    1 MB smaller!  That also fixed the "X-File" problem of letting
    config.{status,log} files behind.
  * debian/control:
    - General redo of Build-Depends.  Droppped python2.3 in favour of
      python2.4 (closes: #395993).
    - Removed [!ia64] for g++-4.1 in Build-Depends.
    - Bumped Standards-Version to 3.7.2.2.
  * Removed all the patches from 0.5.12.0 except for the additional #include
    <set> in modules/quadrilateral_remeshing/quadrilateral_remeshing.cpp. This
    version builds normally with g++-4.1.1.
  * Updated config.guess and config.sub to latest versions.
  * Fixed building in order to support the new Python policy (closes: #380849):
     - debian/control: Added python-support (>= 0.3) to B-D.  Bumped
       dependency on debhelper (>= 5.0.37.2).
     - Added an 'XB-Python-Version: ${python:Versions}' field to k3d.
     - Added an 'XS-Python-Version: current' field to k3d.
     - debian/rules: Replaced dh_python with dh_pysupport.
     - debian/pycompat: Created with a content of '2'.

  * debian/control:
    - Updated Standards-Version to 3.7.2.1.
    - Added a build-time dependency on g++-4.1 (>=4.1.1-9) due to some
      internal g++ problem in earlier versions.
    - Update dependencies to new X.Org packages.
  * Acknowledge NMUs. Thanks, Pierre Habouzit (closes: #368246) and Martin
    Michlmayr.
  * This version shows correctly icons in the toolbar (closes: #356037).
  * Changed configure in order to try only pkg-config --libs ImageMagick++
    instead of Magick++-config --libs, thus riding of spureous dependencies.
    Closes: #347399.
  * Added a patch to modules/annotation/reference_image_2d.cpp from upstream
    CVS in order to compile with g++ 4.1.1.
  * Made the same with modules/gts/module.cpp.
  * Patched modules/quadrilateral_remeshing/quadrilateral_remeshing.cpp with

    - Many code cleanups, reorganizations and updates, pulled out several
      deprecated plugins (including JavaScript engine).
    - New selection system using k3d::mesh_selection properties for
      undoable-selection and full integration with the Directed Graph.
    - document node collection is stored/serialized/loaded in node-creation order,

    - NGUI selection button control displays tooltips and disables buttons based
      on selection state.
    - Tutorials are possible now using almost all the tools.
    - Added Aqsis plugins.
    - Added real sphere implementation to PolySphere and Quads Only option,
      renamed existing one to "Spherical Cylinder".

  * Removed /usr/share/k3d/shaders/layered from debian/k3d.dirs, as it is now
    included upstream.
  * I do not fully understand why k3d is not using PNG icons. In the
    meanwhile, added a hardcoded runtime dependency on librsvg2-2 in order to
    use the scalable icons.
  * Patched modules/quadrilateral_remeshing/quadrilateral_remeshing.cpp in
    order to support new k3dsdk.

k3d (0.5.0.33-0pre2) experimental; urgency=low

  * Rebuild package with last changes.
  * debian/control: Added (>> 2.9.5-5) to librsvg2-bin dependency, as all the
    previous versions did not include my patch to librsvg-bin, thus breaking
    rsvg->png conversion.
  * Added /usr/share/k3d/shaders/layered to debian/k3d.dirs to workaround a
    startup error.

k3d (0.5.0.33-0pre1) experimental; urgency=low

  * 0.6 prerelease:
    - Lots of bug fixes!
    - Lots of enhancements!
    - Lots of code!
    - Lots of new funcionalities!
    - Lots of new bugs!
  * This package is now compiled against a current unstable (closes: #331104).
  * I understand that this bug came in when gcc 4.0 was used to build this
    package. This new release does not have this problem (closes: #320904).
  * New release does not have javascript at all. It was dropped in favour of
    Python (closes: #326876).
  * Stripped down boost/ from the tarball, as we are going to use external
    boost libraries.
  * New package will be compiled with gcc 4.0 on amd64, and boost libraries
    are not now included (see above), thus not having this problem (closes:
    #278966).
  * Activated again graphviz in the configure line, as it is out of non-free
    now.
  * debian/control:
    - Build-Depends now reflect the current unstable environment.
    - Added libgtkmm-2.4-dev to dependencies.
    - Added gettext.
    - Removed automake1.6 (closes: #335125).
    - Build-Depend on librsvg2-bin > 2.9.5-5 as it was broken for relative
      paths as used in share/ngui/rasterized/Makefile.
    - k3d-doc package has gone, as the documentation is now the wiki.
  * Added full Python support to debian/control, dh_python to debian/rules,
    and ${python:Depends} to the Depends line.
  * Fixed some whitespace in djpig's NMU entry, confusing lintian.
  * debian/copyright: Changed FSF address.

k3d (0.4.5.0-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Damn. I did not remember why I had automake1.6 in Build-Depends...missing,
    install-sh, and all that scripting stuff is symlinked to the original
    files included in automake1.6. For less headaches, I will include it in
    the Build-Depends for now.

    Build-Depend on libsuperlu3-dev (closes: #295663, #298239).
  * sdpgtk/Makefile.in: Added -I/usr/X11R6/include for trying to solve the
    FTBFS error in almost all the architectures.
