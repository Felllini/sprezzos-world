Description: GNU Prolog compiler
 GNU Prolog is a free Prolog compiler with constraint solving over finite
 domains (FD) developed at INRIA by Daniel Diaz.  GNU Prolog is based on two
 systems developed by the same author (with lot of code rewriting and a lot of
 new extensions): wamcc and clp(FD).  Much work has been devoted to make it
 ISO compatible, full compliance being one of its goals.
 .
 This package contains the compiler and runtime system for the ISO
 standard version of GNU Prolog.
