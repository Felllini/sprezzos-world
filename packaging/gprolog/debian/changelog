    programs (closes: #452958)
  * Revert to the default GCC (4.1) because 4.2 doesn't seem to be
    up-to-date on several architectures...  eventually this will allow
    gprolog to migrate to testing.
  * Re-close erroneously reopened bugs (closes: #397294, #412671)

gprolog (1.2.18-17) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix non-ascii character in doc/use.tex; this only seems to be a
    problem with more recent versions of hevea.  (closes: #397135)
  * Fix unaligned access on amd64.  This is done in a way which I'd rather
    not have to confess: I had GCC produce assembly code, which is then
    patched via a sed script before being fed to as.  Thanks to
    ramune@net-ronin.org for pointing out the location of the problem.
    (closes: #356406)
  * Fixed a few things in order to be able to use more recent versions of
    gcc, most notably casts in lvalues.  As of now, gcc 4.1 can be used to
    compile gprolog!
  * Doesn't leave anything in /etc/alternatives nor /usr/bin after being
    purged.  (closes: #358256)

    just about all of them.

gprolog (1.2.18-15) unstable; urgency=low

  * include mips and mipsel in Architecture: in debian/control, as the

  * Acknowledge NMUs (1.2.18-11.1 and -11.2).
  * debian/rules: removed bashisms (closes: #265032).  Thanks Roland
    Stigge <stigge@antcom.de>
  * debian/menu: use gprolog-iso instead of gprolog (alternative) to
    satisfy lintian.
  * src/src/Ma2Asm/powerpc_any.c: fix duplicate patch (same problem as
    fixed in 1.2.18-10 for amd64)
  * src/src/Ma2Asm/ma2asm_inst.c: try to ignore OS for mips architecture.
  * Hopefully this version might finally make it into testing, now that
    it's no longer considered x86-only (it was being held because the
    buildds weren't taking it and yet there were old alpha and sparc
    versions lying around), so I'm closing the can't-build for sarge,
    which applied to a very old version (closes: #268671).

  * BipsPl/format_c.c: urk... bump temp buffer sizes from 2K to 64K.
  * BipsPl/stream_supp.c: Stream_Printf(): str[] is now dynamically-sized

    nasty one!!!
