Description: Library for Spotify's streaming music service
 Despotify is an open source client and library for Spotify‘s streamed
 music platform. It’s the result of a few hackers spending a ridiculous
 amount of time reverse engineering Spotify’s official application,
 hunting for security issues.
 .
 A Spotify Premium account is required to use this library.
