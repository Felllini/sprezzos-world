 3D Slicer Contribution and Software License Agreement ("Agreement")
 Version 1.0 (December 20, 2005)
 .
 This Agreement covers contributions to and downloads from the 3D
 Slicer project ("Slicer") maintained by The Brigham and Women's
 Hospital, Inc. ("Brigham"). Part A of this Agreement applies to
 contributions of software and/or data to Slicer (including making
 revisions of or additions to code and/or data already in Slicer). Part

 Your contribution of software and/or data to Slicer (including prior
 to the date of the first publication of this Agreement, each a
 "Contribution") and/or downloading, copying, modifying, displaying,
 distributing or use of any software and/or data from Slicer
 (collectively, the "Software") constitutes acceptance of all of the

 1. As used in this Contribution Agreement, "you" means the individual
    contributing the Contribution to Slicer and the institution or
    entity which employs or is otherwise affiliated with such
    individual in connection with such Contribution.
 .
 2. This Contribution Agreement applies to all Contributions made to
    Slicer, including without limitation Contributions made prior to
    the date of first publication of this Agreement. If at any time you
    make a Contribution to Slicer, you represent that (i) you are
    legally authorized and entitled to make such Contribution and to
    grant all licenses granted in this Contribution Agreement with
    respect to such Contribution; (ii) if your Contribution includes
    any patient data, all such data is de-identified in accordance with
    U.S. confidentiality and security laws and requirements, including
    but not limited to the Health Insurance Portability and
    Accountability Act (HIPAA) and its regulations, and your disclosure
    of such data for the purposes contemplated by this Agreement is
    properly authorized and in compliance with all applicable laws and
    regulations; and (iii) you have preserved in the Contribution all
    applicable attributions, copyright notices and licenses for any
    third party software or data included in the Contribution.
 .
 3. Except for the licenses granted in this Agreement, you reserve all
    right, title and interest in your Contribution.

    have no liability arising in connection with claims resulting from
    your breach of any of the terms of this Agreement.
 .
 6. YOU WARRANT THAT TO THE BEST OF YOUR KNOWLEDGE YOUR CONTRIBUTION
