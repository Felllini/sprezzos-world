      verbatim copies by documenting file/program/library variations).
    + Change GPL license sections to refer to FSF website (as in
      py-compile, not postal address as common in other (older?) cases).
      Place the website reference below Debian-specific reference to
      actual license file, to slightly emphasize that it is a local edit
      (not copied verbatim from an upstream file).
  * Build-depend on libexpat-dev and enable SHARE_EXPAT. Closes:

    licensed since 8.63). Closes: bug#520215, thanks to Fabian
    Greffrath.
  * Update local CDBS snippets:
    + package-relations.mk:
      - Merge mixture of versioned and unversioned dependencies
      - Use unversioned dependencies when satisfied in oldstable
      - Improve whitespace cleanup
      - Rewrite and silence applying dependencies
      - Handle cdbs 0.4.53 dependency (needed when using debhelper v7)
    + upstream-tarball.mk:
      - Depend unversioned on cdbs (the needed 0.4.39 is in oldstable)
      - Preserve bzip2 tarballs with source format '3.0 (quilt)'.
    + copyright-check.mk:
      - More aggressive scanning (check top 99999 lines, not just 60)
      - Simplify more licensing notices and preserve non-ASCII chars
      - Group hints by sorted owner list (ignoring years)
      - Limit console output both horisontally and vertically
      - Use rev123 of draft DEP5 for hints file
  * Use source format 3.0 "quilt" (and not patchsys-quit.mk). Update
    README.source: normal builds need no special handling now.
  * Add patches:
    + 1009 (Ubuntu): Fix build gs as executable (not shared library)
    + 0743 (Upstream): Fix pdfwrite UTF16-BE pdfmarks not garbling XMP
      metadata

    incomplete - tagged FIXME in the file).
  * Build-depend on libtiff-dev and enable use of libtiff.
  * Update symbols files, and avoid Linux-only realloc symbol on Hurd
    (we currently do not maintain symbols files for other non-Linux
    archs). Closes: bug#546017, thanks to Pino Toscano.
  * Bump Standards-Version to 3.8.4.

    those symbols aren't simply tied to little-endian archs after all).
    Closes: bug#533771, thanks to Kurt Roeckx.
  * Set urgency=high as above affects only build-routines (not actual
    contents of built binaries), no other release blockers occured for 9

  [Till Kamppeter]
  * debian/libgs8.shlibs: Removed. All libgs8 versions should have the same
    API and ABI. The artificial restriction set by this file required all
    reverse dependencies to be rebuilt for every stable release of Ghostscript.
  * debian/patches/35_disable_libcairo.dpatch: Added possibility to
    compile Ghostscript without the "cairo" output device. The device
    is still in experimental state and with its dependency on libcairo
    it pulls in a dependency on X.
  * debian/control, debian/rules: Build Ghostscript without the "cairo"
    output device.
  * debian/patches/38_pxl-duplex.dpatch: The Duplex option of the "pxlmono"
    and "pxlcolor" drivers did not work.
  * debian/patches/39_pxl-resolution.dpatch: The resolution must be also set
    as PJL command for the "pxlmono" and "pxlcolor" drivers.
  * debian/patches/42_gs-init-ps-delaybind-fix.dpatch: Make "ps2ascii" working
    again (Upstream bug #690124) - closes: #81430, #229748, #131528
  * debian/patches/45_bjc600-bjc800-pdf-input.dpatch: Fix setting of the
    "DitheringType" option. With PDF input Ghostscript crashes, with
    PostScript input the "DitheringType" option was probably ignored
    (Upstream bug #690032).
  * debian/patches/48_cups-output-device-pdf-duplex-uninitialized-memory.patch.dpatch:
    Fixed several bugs in the "cups" (CUPS Raster) output device:
     - Ghostscript crashed with PDF input data
     - The "Duplex" and "MediaWeight" options were ignored
     - There was uninitialized memory and wrong usage of pointers, potential
       cause for segmentation faults or even vulnerabilities
     - There were mismatches in data types, leading to possible breakage
       of the "AdvanceDistance", "MediaWeight", and "cupsStringXX" options.
    (Upstream bug #690101).
  * debian/local/pdftoraster/pdftoraster.c,
    debian/local/pdftoraster/pdftoraster.convs, debian/rules: Added pdftoraster
    filter from the Ghostscript SVN repository - closes: #505282
  * debian/patches/50_lips4-floating-point-exception: Fixed floating-point
    exception in "lips4" and other drivers (Upstream bug #690122).
  * debian/patches/52_cups-device-logging.dpatch: Made logging of the "cups"
    output device much less verbose. The log of one jub in debug mode did not
    fit into the maximum log file size of CUPS.
  * debian/patches/55_pcl-input-slot-fix.dpatch: Made the paper tray selection
    via "-dMediaPosition=..." in the PCL 4/5/5e drivers work (Upstream bug
    #690182).
  * debian/patches/57_pxl-input-slot-fix.dpatch: Made the paper tray selection
    via "-dMediaPosition=..." in the PCL 6/XL drivers work.
  * debian/patches/60_pxl-cups-driver-pdf.dpatch: Made the PCL-XL CUPS filter
    and PPDs work with PDF input.
  * debian/patches/62_onebitcmyk-pdf.dpatch: Check the whole Decode array to
    detect special cases of identity and inverse decoding in PDF files 
    (Upstream bug #690178).
  * debian/ghostscript.postinst: Added automatic update of the PPD files
    of already existing print queues.
  * debian/ghostscript.postinst: Do not try to update the PPDs of existing
    print queues if CUPS is not installed or not running.
  * debian/patches/60_pxl-cups-driver-pdf.dpatch: The pstopxl filter did not
    remove its temporary file after finishing.
  * debian/patches/65_too-big-temp-files-1.dpatch: Ghostscript produced much 
    too big temporary files (> 10 GB) when printing photos from GNOME apps in 
    1200 dpi. Part 1 of the fix which reduces the temp file size to less than 
    2 GB (Upstream bug #690133).
  * debian/patches/67_too-big-temp-files-2.dpatch: Complete fix for the too big
    temporary files. Now the bug is completely fixed. Temp files are not much
    bigger than the jobs themselves now (Upstream bug #690133).
  * debian/patches/70_take-into-account-data-in-stream-buffer-before-refill.dpatch:
    Certain files lead to a Ghostscript error due to wrong handling of the
    stream buffer (Upstream bug #690090).

    package, they go into libgs-dev.
  * debian/patches/40_cups_filters_with_buffered_input.dpatch: Modified
    cups/psto* filters to let Ghostscript always use buffered input. This
    works around a Ghostscript bug which prevents printing encrypted PDF

    (Ghostscript bug #689577, Ubuntu bug LP: #172264)

  * Non-maintainer upload.
  * Fix long-standing implicit pointer conversions by backporting a fix from
    SVN revision 8232, as pointed by Dann Frazier (Closes: #422723):
     - 40_implicit_pointer_conversion_fix.dpatch added for this purpose. It
       also contains an additional tweak for src/gpmisc.c so that no attempt
       to use fdopen64() is made, fdopen() is the way to go. That tweak also
       solves the FTBFS on GNU/kFreeBSD (Closes: #430337).
     - DEB_AUTO_UPDATE_AUTOCONF set to “yes” in debian/rules so that the
       configure script gets updated at build time (the needed build
       dependencies are already there).

ghostscript (8.60.dfsg.1-0ubuntu1) gutsy; urgency=low

  * This is the first Debian/Ubuntu package reflecting Artifex' move to do
    the head development of Ghostscript under GPL and the merger of ESP
    Ghostscript into GPL Ghostscript which followed after that.
  * Renamed from "gs-gpl" to "ghostscript" on agreement with Debian Ghostscript
    maintainer Masayuki Hatta
  * New upstream release
    o SVN snapshot rev 7979, branch "gs-esp-gpl-merger"
    o This is the head of the Ghostscript development now. There is no separate
      AFPL Ghostscript any more. See http://www.ghostscript.com/awki/News.
    o All extra functionality of ESP Ghostscript is merged into GPL
      Ghostscript now and the development of ESP Ghostscript is discontinued.
      See http://www.cups.org/espgs/.
  * debian/control: Added tags and transitional packages to make this package
    (ghostscript) replacing gs-esp and gs-afpl (Closes: LP#47432, LP#47458,
    LP#75894, LP#83769, LP#103595, LP#105752, LP#108159, LP#109304).
  * debian/rules, debian/control, debian/dirs, debian/ghostscript.*,
    debian/README.Debian, debian/gs.defoma: Merged in gs-common.
  * debian/control: Set Ubuntu maintainer.
  * debian/rules: Activated full functionality by appropriate "./configure"
    command line options. This is now the one and only Ghostscript in Ubuntu
    Linux.
  * debian/rules: Do not build static executable, to reduce the build time
    to one half of the former build time of gs-esp (or to not double the
    build time of ghostscript).
  * debian/rules, debian/control: Split package into ghostscript, libgs8,
    libgs-dev, and ghostscript-x, like we did with gs-esp, also split off
    documentation into ghostcript-doc.
  * debian/NEWS: Added info about merger of ESP and GPL Ghostscript
  * debian/patches/: Removed 01_gsdir_for_gs-gpl.dpatch, 
    02_fontpath_for_debian, 20_additional_drivers, 21_additional_drivers_mak,
    22_gdi_support, 23_hl12x0_support: They are not needed any more after
    merging in the ESP GS functionality and moving to "ghostscript" as 
    package name.
  * debian/patches/09_ijs_krgb_support.dpatch: Updated to version 1.3
    of the KRGB patch (from HPLIP 1.7.3).
  * debian/patches/04_gdevxini_segv_fix.dpatch: Removed, it makes the X
    device being reopened on every page size change and breaks output with
    tools like gv (gv hangs without showing any page).
  * debian/patches/40_fix_imdi_patch.dpatch: Fixed imdi directory location
    in src/devs.mak
  * debian/patches/50_gv_kghostview_compatibility.dpatch: Fixed compatibility
    with GUIs like gv and kghostview (see upstream bug 689237,
    http://bugs.ghostscript.com/show_bug.cgi?id=689237, note: reintroduces
    upstream bug 687125 but that bug is much less a problem).
  * debian/ghostscript.postinst: update-alternatives configuration does not get
    correctly updated when the obsolete gs-esp and gs-afpl packages get removed
    via the transitional packages. Let the post-install script of the
    ghostscript package reset update-alternatives to auto mode for such a case.

    NOTE: even if CMap files can be found somewhere in the font path, gs-esp
    fails to prepare a composed font with CIDFont and CMap. This hack is
    a workaround for "the CMap files must be put into the first directory of
    the font path" problem.  Many Thanks Akira TAGOH for suggestion.

    mono displays at least (closes: #138844).
  * src/unix-gcc.mak: Reenable the pipe device as it seems harmless after
    all and many filters will break as they are using this feature to
    circumvent the old Ghostscript problem with -sOutputFile=- when
    the PostScript file writes text to stdout which interferes with the
    printer commands... (closes: #138364).
  * debian/control: Remove the reference to gs-pdfencrypt which is now 
    obsolete as it is included in the official Ghostscript now.

  * Lintian cleanup:

    + Convert History[56].htm to changes.gz using html2text to have an

  * Included a few important patches from the Ghostscript CVS:
    + Handle the margins from an ijs server correctly. It was my hope that 
      this would account for #141608, but that does not seem to be the
      case :(
    + src/gdevx.c: Patched to use the "right" color depth on X11 for 
      all cases. It used to take the actual number of bits to store
      the color info as opposed to the number of bits actually used.
    + lib/pdf2dsc.ps: This was broken because of the security fix. 
      Patched to open the files before dropping privileges.

  * lib/stcolor.ps: Compare the product name with "GNU Ghostscript" instead
    of just "Ghostscript" to detect the interpreter (closes: #108120).

  * debian/docs: Install that file as $(docdir)/README.stp for those
    using that driver and needing some infos (closes: #122099).
    + debian/README.Debian: Refer the user to README.stp.
  * debian/rules: Install the documentation of the pcl3 driver

  * debian/control: Build-Depend on libgimpprint-dev.
  * debian/gen-makefile: Add support for the DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS environment
    variable (more precisely, the debug option leads to a build with 
    debugging support and exported private variables).
  * Add in the CJK support using the patch from 
    Yasuhiro Take <take@debian.org>. A huge "THANK YOU" to him for his 
    work!!! His changes:
    + Add debian/patches/gs-cjk-M2-R1+CJKPDF.diff & .info, and apply it
      to the source.
    + debian/control: Conflicts: Add gs-cjk-resource (<< 1.20010910-1) because
      the new gs-cjk patch requires new gs-cjk-resource that i've already
      prepared and doesn't work with older ones.
    + debian/control: Depends: Add gs-common (>= 0.2) because font 
      configuration for the new gs-cjk patch is completely different from 
      the old one.
  * debian/control: Removed the conflict with gs_x, gs_svga and gs_both. 
    I don't even remember when those packages where in Debian, probably
    before Debian 1.3 so a direct upgrade is going to fail anyway. And 
    with intermediate upgrades it will not be a problem.
  * src/imainarg.c: Reapply the papersize diff from debian/patches.

  * debian/postinst: Completely rewritten.
    + Fixes the bashism reported by Joey Hess (closes: #92056).
    + Does not mess with /usr/local anymore (closes: #57276).
  * unix-gcc.mak: Readd the x11 device (closes: #92586).
  * debian/config: Change the priority of the defoma questions to
    low. I don't see how the defaults can cause any problems.
  * debian/shlibs.local: Removed. Let's see if it works without.

    (closes: #65832, #87673).

  * debian/control: Removed Conflicts with local defoma packages made
    by Yasuhiro.

    and move the targets out of the ifeq so that one can run the file
    standalone.

    - Don't patch zmedia2.c since upstream changed it since 5.10.
    - Adjust for name change of the main makefile.

  * debian/patches/hp8xx:
    - Update the devs.mak diff for gs 5.50.
    - Adjust for name change of main makefile.

gs (5.10-1) unstable frozen; urgency=low

  * Ghostscript 5.10 is GPL! 
    This package essentially corresponds to package gs-aladdin_5.10-12,
    but redistributed under GPL. Changes w.r.t. gs-aladdin_5.10-12
    are:
      * Corrected "regulamentations" --> "regulations" 
        in description of package.
      * Filenames in script pdf2ps are now enclosed in double quotes
      * Fixed the manpages for bdftops, printafm and wftopfa, 
        so that they work with apropos.
    The various patches to ghostscript 5.10 that have been proposed
    by L.P.Deutsch and that appear in gs-aladdin_5.10-12 also appear
    in this package.

gs (4.03-6) unstable; urgency=low

    is changed accordingly).

 -- Marco Pistore <pistore@di.unipi.it>  Mon,  7 Dec 1998 22:06:21 +0100

gs (4.03-5) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed the manpages for bdftops, printafm and wftopfa,
    so that they work with apropos.

  * Removed *.1.gz files from /usr/doc/gs (they already are in the
    /usr/man/man1 directory).

 -- Marco Pistore <pistore@di.unipi.it>  Fri,  6 Nov 1998 10:52:31 +0100

gs (4.03-4) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed files stcolor.ps and stcinfo.ps so that they recognize that
    they are called by GNU ghostscript; thanks to Gordon Matzigkeit
    (closes Bug#28726).

 -- Marco Pistore <pistore@di.unipi.it>  Thu,  5 Nov 1998 21:44:07 +0100

gs (4.03-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Changed "Recommends: gs-pdfencrypt" to "Suggests: gs-pdfencrypt" in
    control file (closes Bug#27431)
  * Removed "Provides: gs_x, gs_svga, gs_both", since "_" cannot appear
    in package names, and no packages should depend on these quite old 
    virtual packages.
  * Changed directory name for the libjpeg source from ../libjpeg-6a
    to ../libjpeg: so it does not depend on the particular version
    of libjpeg (changes in files gcc-head.mak, debian/rules and 
    debian/jpeg).
  * Linked against libjpeg-6b.

 -- Marco Pistore <pistore@di.unipi.it>  Sat, 10 Oct 1998 00:01:15 +0200

gs (4.03-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Now /usr/lib/ghostscript/common is searched for library files
    before /usr/lib/ghostscript/X.YY (where X.YY is the version of 
    ghostscript). This is useful for installing packages like
    gs-pdfencrypt, that provide (modified) library files
    to ghostscript that are independent from the version of gs
    (also gs.1 is changed accordingly)
  * Now gs-pdfencrypt (in the nonUS distribution) is suggested by 
    gs-aladdin. Changed the message in the file pdf_sec.ps so that
    it suggests to install that package if an encrypted pdf file is
    being processed.
  * Linked against libpng2 (closes Bug#26924)

  * Added man pages for all the binaries
  * All example files in /usr/doc/gs/examples start now with %!

    (there is really no reason to put this script in /usr/bin)
  * Patched devs.mak and gdevpng.c so to work with version 0.96 of libpng.
  * Patched gdevcdj.c so that device cdeskjet works 
    (and is identical to cdj500)
  * Patched gdevl256.c imainarg.c so that superuser rights are given away
    as soon as possible, and re-obtained only to start svgalib (see 
    /usr/doc/gs/README.Debian and /usr/doc/gs/setuid.Debian)
  * Patched imainarg.c to set default paper accordig to the system paper
    as reported by libpaper, also patched imaiarg.c so that the lvga256
    device is chosen as the default one if gs is not called from X
  * Patched zlib.mak: here the shared file for zlib is called libz, 
    not libgz

    called by the user)
