NAME
----
aqhbci-tool4 - Command line tools for setup, modification and debugging of HBCI settings.

SYNOPSIS
--------
'aqhbci-tool4' [global options] <command> [command options]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
The aqhbci-tool4(1) command can be used to setup and manage AqBanking's HBCI users, customers and accounts.

OPTIONS
-------
Two common options need to be distinguished carefully from each
other: "-c CUSTOMER_ID" refers to the German "Kunden-ID" or
"Kundennummer". "-u USER_ID" refers to the German
"Benutzerkennung". If your bank has specified both to you, you
need to check carefully not to confuse one with the other.
