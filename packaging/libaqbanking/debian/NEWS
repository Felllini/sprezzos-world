libaqbanking (3.0.1-3) unstable; urgency=low

  Important information for users upgrading from versions prior to 3.x
  ====================================================================

  * Directory for AqBanking's configuration and data storage changed
    ----------------------------------------------------------------

    Users which were using prior versions of AqBanking should know that
    AqBanking now stores its configuration and data in a different directory
    than previous versions did. There are very good chances that you can reuse
    your old configuration, but you need to copy all old files into a new
    directory. For that purpose execute the following command in order to take
    over your old configuration for use with AqBanking 3:

       cp -a ~/.banking ~/.aqbanking

  * Key file format changed
    -----------------------

    Unfortunately the format of very old AqBanking (former OpenHBCI) key files
    is not supported with AqBanking 3.x any more. Thus, if you are using a key
    file, you possibly need to update it, especially if you created it using
    OpenHBCI (the ancestor of AqBanking). For further information on how to
    update your key file please read the instructions in file

      /usr/share/doc/aqbanking-tools/README.keyfile-update

  If other users using your system might be affected please inform them about
  the changes mentioned above.
