Updating Key Files
==================

Unfortunately the format of very old AqBanking (former OpenHBCI) key files is
not supported with AqBanking 3.x any more. Thus, if you are using a key file,
you possibly need to update it, especially if you created it using OpenHBCI
(the ancestor of AqBanking).

For German instructions please read chapter 3.1.2 "Vorbereiten der
Schl√ºsseldatei" of the AqBanking manual available here:
http://www.aquamaniac.de/sites/download/download.php?package=06&release=01&file=01

IMPORTANT: Applications using AqBanking 2 can continue to use the key file
	   after following the subsequent instructions. Only the very old
	   OpenHBCI will not work any more.

*******************************************************************
** PLEASE MAKE A BACKUP COPY OF YOUR KEY FILE BEFORE CONTINUING! **
*******************************************************************

Please make sure that you have the package gwenhywfar-tools installed.
To update your key file you need to execute the following command:

  gct-tool update -t ohbci -n /path/to/keyfile

You need to replace the text after the "-n" option with the path to *your*
keyfile (i.e. "/path/to/keyfile" is an example).

You will be asked to enter your key file's current password. If reading your
key file using the entered password succeeds, you will be asked to enter a new
password, which needs to be confirmed (i.e. entered again).

After this step AqBanking 3 will be able to work with *very old* key files too.
