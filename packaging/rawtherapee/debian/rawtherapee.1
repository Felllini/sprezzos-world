.TH RAWTHERAPEE 1 "January 8, 2010"
.SH NAME
rawtherapee \- A free RAW converter and digital photo processing software
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B rawtherapee [image\-file]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBRawTherapee\fP is used to adjust some of the most often changed parameters
when optimizing digital images. A normal user often just wants to adjust the
white balance or brightness of a photo he took. Instead of using a big and
expensive image editor you could use a small and fast (specialized) tool like
RawTherapee.
.br
More and more cameras also support RAW formats. RAW files usually offer higher
color depth than JPGs (JPG is limited to 8 Bit per color). So the adjustments are
done with the high color depth and then afterwards converted to or saved as JPGs.
RawTherapee supports JPG (8 bit), PNG (8 or 16 bit) and TIFF (8 or 16 bit). All
image processing is done in 16 bit/channel mode.
.br
Different to other RAW converters it can use EAHD as demosaicing algorithm. The
raw loading engine of RawTherapee is based on dcraw.
