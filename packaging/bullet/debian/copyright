Comment:
 The source tarball was repacked because it contained non-free files or
 software which has already been packaged for Debian. Please use
 debian/rules get-orig-source to retrieve the DFSG compatible sources.
 .
 The Bullet project was started by Erwin Coumans but many other people have
 made a contribution to it in the past. Please refer to the AUTHORS file in the
 source package for more information.

Comment:
 The file glext.h was released under Version 1.1 of SGI's Free Software
 License which is considered non-free by the Debian Project. However SGI
 revised the license and replaced it with version 2.0 which is DFSG free.
 Paragraph 8 grants the following right:
 "Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the
 License, Recipient may, for the duration of the license, continue to use it
 under the terms of that version, or choose to use such Covered Code under the
 terms of any subsequent version published bi SGI." Therefore Debian uses
 version 2.0.
