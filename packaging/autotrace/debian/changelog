autotrace (0.31.1-12) unstable; urgency=low

  * Update build system to work with current libpstoedit-dev packages
    that don't ship pstoedit-config:
     - Patch configure.in to try pkg-config in addition to
       libpstoedit-config.
     - Ship old pstoedit.m4 in the source package such that the aclocal.m4
       file can still be built without losing the ability to use
       libpstoedit-config instead.
  * Fix possible problem with compilers that may give enum { false, true }
    a different size than int, and other minor compiler warnings.
  * Bump Standards-Version to 3.7.2.

 -- Henning Makholm <henning@makholm.net>  Fri,  9 Jun 2006 22:03:18 +0200

autotrace (0.31.1-11) unstable; urgency=low

  * Rebuild for new libpstoedit0c2a package.
  * Zlib is not actually used by autotrace; remove build-dependency
    and comment out configure check.

  * Override the ad-hoc build system to avoid transitive shlibs dependencies.
  * Further overrides to produce a sane /usr/lib/pkgconfig/autotrace.pc
  * The autotrace-config script is broken by design; don't ship it.
    All of these per Steve Langasek in
    <http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2005/11/msg00016.html>

autotrace (0.31.1-10) unstable; urgency=low

  * Rebuild after libmagick transition; updated build-dependencies
    (Closes: #332456, #335501)
  * Artificially raise error-threshold to at least 0.002, because zero
    or negative values lead to algorithm failure. (Closes: #328822)

 -- Henning Makholm <henning@makholm.net>  Wed,  9 Nov 2005 21:58:42 +0100

    (Closes: #292246).
  * New dependencies after C++ ABI transition. (Closes: #317735)
  * Bumped Standards-Version to 3.6.2; no changes were necessary.

 -- Henning Makholm <henning@makholm.net>  Sat, 13 Aug 2005 16:59:05 +0200

autotrace (0.31.1-8) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add watch file
  * Make lintian happy again by letting the Build-Depends line be
    a single (long) line.
  * Apply patch from Steve Langasek (in bug #262469) to remove direct
    dependencies from the autotrace binary package to libmagick.
    (Closes: #260938, as far as it is possible to do in the autotrace
    package).
  * Apply patch from Paul Sladen to eliminate redundant closepaths
    in pdf output.

 -- Henning Makholm <henning@makholm.net>  Mon,  3 Jan 2005 06:45:24 +0000

autotrace (0.31.1-7) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Rebuild for libtiff4 transition

 -- Henning Makholm <henning@makholm.net>  Sun,  1 Aug 2004 12:05:45 +0100

autotrace (0.31.1-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Rebuild against new libmagick packages. (Closes: #245603).
  * Remove debian/fixmagickversions; we now build-depend on libmagick6
    which never exhibited the particular bug that script worked around.
  * Remove temporary (build-)dependencies on libplot-dev; libpstoedit-dev
    has been fixed for a while now.
  * Fixed upstream configure script which does not like libmagick 6.x
  * Include ltmain.sh in the autofoo stuff in debian/rules; the one shipped
    by upstream had drifted out of sync with Debian's libtool package.
    This should also please GNU/*BSD porters (#242950).

 -- Henning Makholm <henning@makholm.net>  Tue, 27 Apr 2004 02:46:16 +0100

autotrace (0.31.1-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Copyright file now contains the actual copyright notices from the
    source.
  * Do not distribute the AUTHORS and README files, which tell nothing
    not already documented in the binary package.
  * However, README contained a minimal example of how to use the
    libautotrace library. Ship it as
    /usr/share/doc/libautotrace-dev/examples/sample.c, after fixing
    typo.
  * General cleanup of debian/rules. Explicitly suppress use of libming,
    to avoid FTBFS bugs caused by API changes in the library.
  * Re-computed build-dependencies from scratch. Libdps was not actually
    used. Liblcms1-dev, libfreetype6-dev, libtiff3g-dev, libxml2-dev,
    xlibs-dev, libbz2-dev, and libwmf-dev are all pulled in by
    libpstoedit-dev and/or libmagic-dev, and the source does not refer to
    any of their include files, so there should be no reason to
    build-depend on them explicitly. Libplot-dev can be removed from
    the control file once libpstoedit-dev has been fixed (#240382) to
    pull it in.
  * Fix dependencies for libautotrace-dev. (Closes: #239990).
  * Add manpage for autotrace-config.

    versions of libmagick(++) that contained libraries with wrong sonames.

autotrace (0.31.1-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Rebuild against latest libs (again, again!). (Closes: #224287)
