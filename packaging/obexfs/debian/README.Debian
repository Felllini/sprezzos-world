ObexFS is just a thin layer wrapping a basic ObexFTP client into FUSE callbacks.

ObexAutoFS
==========
This package includes two fuse modules: obexfs and obexautofs.

For obexautofs there is no need for a peer on startup.
It will scan for Bluetooth and USB devices and show them with their MAC as
well as by their nickname. (scanning for IrDA or serial transport
isnâ€™t implemented, yet.) 


Plain mount
===========
As root, you can use:
mount -t fuse obexautofs /tmp/mnt
  or
mount -t fuse "obexfs#<obexfs-options>" /tmp/mnt

This will obviously not work if those are not in /etc/fstab (see below).
To mount as user, you must be in group "fuse" and the "fuse" kernel
module must be loaded. If you have a static /dev, you must also create
the /dev/fuse device node.
Then you can use:
obexfs <obexfs-options> -- <fuse-options> <mountpoint>
or
obexautofs -- <fuse-options> <mountpoint>

To unmount, use:
fusermount -u <mountpoint>


Automount
=========
Add to /etc/autofs/auto.misc:
obex            -fstype=fuse,allow_other    :obexautofs#
myobex          -fstype=fuse,allow_other    :obexfs#-b 00-11-22-33-44-55 -B 6

By default only the user mounting with fuse can see the fs. That is why the
option allow_other is needed. It might be a security risk. 


/etc/fstab
==========
Entries in /etc/fstab might look like this:
obexautofs#user@host:/    /mnt/host    fuse    allow_other    0 0
obexfs#-b00-11-22-33-44-55    /mnt/host    fuse    allow_other    0 0

By default only the user mounting with fuse can see the fs. That is why the
option allow_other is needed. It might be a security risk.
Using fstab spaces in mount point name (especially before -B option) must be
replaced with their octal character code (040) preceded by \ (backslash), e.g.:
obexfs#-b00-11-22-33-44-55\040-B6    /mnt/host    fuse    allow_other    0 0

Debug
=====
1) mkdir /tmp/mnt
2) obexautofs -- -d -f /tmp/mnt
     or 
   obexfs -b 00:11:22:33:44:55 -B 5 -- -d -f /tmp/mnt
     or 
   obexfs -b 00:11:22:33:44:55  -B 10 /tmp/mnt
3) to unmount: fusermount -u /tmp/mnt
