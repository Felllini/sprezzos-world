  * Updating to CVS HEAD from 2008-05-30.
    Including a fix for an implicit declaration and a few minor bugs.

    - Due to upstream incorporating suggestions and patches from Debian, the
      following patches could be dropped completely:
      + 0004-Update-gen-Rmakefile-to-use-the-systemwide-libtiff-i.patch
      + 0005-Update-cv-Rmakefile-to-use-the-systemwide-libtiff-if.patch

      + no-hardlinks
    - 0009*.patch and 0011*.patch were updated and renamed to
      meta-Rmakefile-missing-deps / cal-Rmakefile-missing-deps

  * debian/rules:
    - Fixing FTBFS on several platforms where sudo is used instead of
      fakeroot. Reason here was quilt which does not clean up created
      directories.

 -- Bernd Zeimetz <bzed@debian.org>  Sat, 17 May 2008 22:57:23 +0200

radiance (3R9-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.
    + Does not include files without sources anymore, dropping the dfsg
      from the version number.
  * debian/rules:
    - Don't use -ffast-math as optimization anymore as it can lead to "zero
      ray direction in localhit" errors. See <48066BAE.4050302@gmx.net> on the
      radiance-general list for details.
    - Use ln -s as value for LN while building, debian/patches/no-hardlinks
      allows us to override the setting for LN now.
    - Use quilt instead of dpatch now.
    - Creating a better src/rt/Version.c while building now, cleaning it up
      properly after the build.
  * debian/control:
    - Adding Vcs-Browser and Vcs-Git fields.
    - Replacing dpatch build-dep by quilt.
  * debian/patches:
    - Moving from dpatch to quilt.
    - Completely refactoring the patches which removed the support for the
      included libtiff. Now they allow to build against the included version
      (which is not shipped in the Debian package) or against a system-wide
      installation of libtiff (which is what we want).
    - Refreshing patches to fit to the new upstream version.
    - Deleting ies2rad-ftbfs-fix, not needed anymore.
    - Deleting rmakefile-clean-fix - Version.c is created and removed by
      debian/rules now.
    - Adding new patch to fix several syntax bugs in manpages.
  * debian/README.Debian-source
    - Updating file to introduce into the usage of the git repository and to
      explain how to retrieve the original source.

  * debian/rules:
    - Fixing a bug where the package FTBFS on systems where /bin/sh is
      linked to /bin/dash. Thanks to Luca Falavigna (Closes: #453810).
  * debian/control:
    - Adding libxext-dev to Build-Depends, thanks to Luca Falavigna
      (Closes: #453811). In Debian libx11-dev depends on libxext-dev, so the
      missing dependency did not result in FTBFS.

  * Building 3R8 with HEAD from 20071122. Also building and installing
    3ds2mgf + 3ds2mgf.1.
  * Moving DEVDIR to /usr/lib/radiance/dev, so we can use /usr/lib/radiance
    for compatibility links to support old renderings. Adding links for
    genrbox and rvu, which were formerly know as genbox and rview.
  * Cleaning up and splitting the patch which renames genbox to genrbox.
  * Upstream ships the source of doc/pdf/raduser1_6.pdf now. Keeping the pdf
    in the source while repackaging and shipping it with radiance-doc.
  * Dropping parts from the patches which were integrated upstream.
  * Building the ogl device files for rholo now, this should speed up rholo
    pretty much.
  * Adding 'pbilat' to radiance-experttools.1 - new bilateral filter.
