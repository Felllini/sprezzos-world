Description: Unit Testing Library for C -- development files
 CUnit is a simple framework for incorporating test cases in your C
 code similar to JUnit or CppUnit. It provides C programmers a basic
 testing functionality with a flexible variety of user interfaces.  It
 uses a simple framework for building test structures, and provides a
 rich set of assertions for testing common data types.  In addition,
 several different interfaces are provided for running tests and
 reporting results.
