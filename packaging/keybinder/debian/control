Package: libkeybinder0
Architecture: any
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends},
         ${misc:Depends}
Description: registers global key bindings for applications
 keybinder is a library for registering global keyboard shortcuts to be used by
 GTK-based applications under the X Window System.
 .
 When a combination of key is pressed, keybinder notifies it to the registering
 application, which can execute one or more operations based on the event
 previously registered.
 .
 Originally written as part of the Tomboy project, keybinder has been
 distributed as stand-alone library let other applications to use key binding.
