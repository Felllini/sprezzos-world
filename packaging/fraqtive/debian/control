Description: draws Mandelbrot and Julia fractals
 Fraqtive is a program for drawing Mandelbrot and Julia fractals.
 It uses a very fast algorithm and generates high quality, smooth
 images. It is fully interactive, allowing for real-time mouse
 navigation and dynamic generation of the Julia fractal preview.
 OpenGL-rendered 3D view of the fractals is also supported.
