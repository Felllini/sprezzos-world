    + Replace auto-update.mk with overloading buildcore.mk.
    + Fix applying buildinfo only once.
    + Fix race condition: check copyright strings in pre-build target

libgd-graph-perl (1.43.08-2.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Non-maintainer upload.
  * Comment out copyright-check.mk; it is not robust enough to avoid random
    false positives on buildds. (Closes: #)

 -- Steinar H. Gunderson <sesse@debian.org>  Thu,  7 Sep 2006 14:10:08 +0200

libgd-graph-perl (1.43.08-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix cdbs snippet copyright-check not cleaning up after itself.

    no real use according to note in Debian Policy 7.6, and is badly
    supported by cdbs.
  * Suggest ttf-dustin (and drop Dustismo font as example file). Thanks
    to linda for noticing.
  * Use search.cpan.org/dist/ (not www.cpan.org/modules/by-modules/) in
    long description.

libgd-graph-perl (1.43-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Buid-depend on imagemagick (needed to make test). Closes: Bug#264830
    (thanks to Roland Stigge <stigge@antcom.de>).
  * Standards-version 3.6.1 (no changes needed). This also closes:
    Bug#210413 (thanks to Peter Palfrader <weasel@debian.org>).
  * Change debian/copyright slightly:
    + Mention "Debian GNU systems" in first line, to emphasize the broad
      range of Debian.
    + Rephraze last sentence pointing to common-licenses, to please
      lintian (the note was technically correct before, but written in a
      way not recognized by lintian).
  * Update watch file:
    + Add comment about usage of the file.
    + Make regexp more generic.
  * Include (and build-depend on) dh-buildinfo.
  * Clean GIF files, generated by 'make test' with recent releases of
    libgd2.
  * Drop direct dependency on libgd (this library never uses the library
    directly, only through the dependency on libgd-text-perl).
  * Set urgency=medium due to the FTBFS of bug#264830 and the fact that no
    binaries have changed by this upload (except being compiled using a
    newer compiler).

libgd-graph-perl (1.40-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.

libgd-graph-perl (1.35+1.36nofont-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release.

    + Make a note in debian/copyright about it.
    + Set urgency=medium on this upload.

libgd-graph-perl (1.35-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Depend on unversioned libgd-perl, now that it is only a virtual
    package (and stable Debian contains libgd-perl way above the
    critical 1.9).
  * Build the package using binary-indep build-target (closes: #157481).
  * Add the non-clause to copyright, just to be on the safe side...

 -- Jonas Smedegaard <dr@jones.dk>  Thu, 22 Aug 2002 09:19:18 +0200
