Description: Shows how objects moving at relativistic speeds look like
 Light Speed! is an OpenGL-based program which illustrates the effects of
 special relativity on the appearance of moving objects. When an object
 accelerates past a few million meters per second, these effects begin to
 grow noticeable, becoming more and more pronounced as the speed of light
 is approached. These relativistic effects are viewpoint-dependent, and
 include shifts in length, object hue, brightness and shape.
 .
 The moving object is, by default, a geometric lattice. 3D Studio and
 LightWave 3D objects may be imported as well. Best of all, the simulator
 is completely interactive, rendering the exotic distortions in real-time!
