Description: system service to manage device colour profiles -- runtime
 colord is a system service that makes it easy to manage, install and generate
 colour profiles to accurately colour manage input and output devices.
 .
 It provides a D-Bus API for system frameworks to query, a persistent data
 store, and a mechanism for session applications to set system policy.
 .
 This package contains a convenience library for GTK+ programs that wish to
 handle colour management to interact with the colord system daemon.
