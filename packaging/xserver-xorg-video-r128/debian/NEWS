xserver-xorg-video-r128 (6.8.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * The standard linux kernels in Debian as of version 2.6.29-1 do not
    contain the firmware necessary to allow the r128 driver to use 3D
    acceleration via DRI. This firmware has been moved to the
    firmware-linux package in non-free, and must be installed to use
    this feature.

xserver-xorg-video-r128 (1:6.8.1~git20080301.d855d208-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * The r128 submodule isn't included in ati anymore. 
    If your /etc/X11/xorg.conf contains Driver "ati", you need to keep 
    xserver-xorg-video-ati installed, or switch to Driver "r128".

xserver-xorg-video-ati (1:6.7.197-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * The X.Org ATI driver supports RandR 1.2 which enables dynamic
    enabling, disabling, resizing, rotating, placing, ... of multiple
    outputs at runtime. You might want to update your /etc/X11/xorg.conf
    accordingly. See http://wiki.debian.org/XStrikeForce/HowToRandR12
    and http://www.intellinuxgraphics.org/dualhead.html for some help.
