Description: next generation TeX engine
 LuaTeX uses Lua scripting both as an extension to the TeX 
 macro language and as an extension to the typesetting 
 engine itself. A (growing) number of TeX internals are 
 made available to the embedded lua interpreter.
 .
 LuaTeX uses code and interfaces from Aleph to improve the 
 typesetting of non-latin alphabet languages, instead of
 the TeXXeT code present in the current releases of pdfTeX. 
 .
 Unicode and OpenType font support are added progressively,
 and regular pdfTeX development will continue in this
 branch as well.
 .
 The multi-lingual extensions are coded and merged by Taco 
 Hoekwater. Swift progress in that area is made possible 
 by a joint grant from Colorado State University and TUG, 
 under the 'Oriental TeX' project.
 .
 This package only contains the barebone binary. If you are
 searching for support file, formats etc install texlive-luatex.
