Hi,

I have just uploaded the archives for a new luatex release, 0.72.0.

This release exists mostly to get back into the habit of releasing,
you can expect another release in a month or so.

There are a few small improvements, but not that many bugs fixed yet
in this version.

Most noticeable changes:

* update various used libraries, including mplib 1.770, poppler 0.21,
   libpng 1.5, and lpeg 0.10.2.

* new 'pdfscanner' lua library.

* various OT math fixes, including \Umathcharnumdef.

* improved placement of bottom accents.

* various other small fixes that have accumulated over the past
   year-and-a-half.


The archives can be downloaded from supelec as usual:

         http://foundry.supelec.fr/gf/project/luatex/

You could also check out the sources via anonymous svn:

   svn co http://foundry.supelec.fr/svn/luatex/tags/beta-0.72.0

Bugs and feature requests can be added to the issue tracker at

Have fun,
