The original tarball is repackaged, in order to remove the shipped debian/
directory, the files example/thedieline.rss, example/JBR-ALLENtrees.htm,
example/yahoo-finance-html-with-errors.html and
example/yahoo-finance-html-with-errors.html (because of missing copyright and/or
license) and the references to them in MANIFEST. To ease the creation of a new
tarball repack.stub can be used, which is also called by uscan(1).
