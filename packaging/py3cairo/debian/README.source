This is repacked source of the upstream package.

  - The upstream package contains "waf" binary. It doesn't satisfy Debian Policy.
    On this package, waf binary is replaced with uncompressed scripts.
    More details: http://wiki.debian.org/UnpackWaf

  - The upstream package contains html documents which are compiled with sphinx.
    It contains a binary "objects.inv", so this package rebuilds documents from
    source files.
