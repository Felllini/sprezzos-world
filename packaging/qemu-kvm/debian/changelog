  * 1.1.0 upstream release, finally.  No changes from the previous source.
  * added two patches from upstream qemu-kvm/stable-1.1 branch:

  * dont-try-to-hotplug-cpu.patch (from Ubuntu package).  CPU hot-plug
    never really worked in qemu-kvm correctly.  This temporary patch
    disables this feature, returning an error instead of crashing.

  * new upstream prerelease: 1.1  (Closes: #652329, #672287, #640139, #672112)
    (This is not official release yet, it is based on 1.1-rc4 plus a few fixes
     from upstream stable-1.1 git branch.  The release isn't out due to some
     last-minute regression issue, once the regression will be dealt with
     we'll release 1.1 into unstable)
    Removed all bugfix patches (integrated upstream)
    Refreshed the configuration (and removed 03_use_etc_kvm_not_etc_qemu.patch)
  * refresh debian/optional-features, mention/enable new configure switches
  * build-depend on libcap-dev for now, to build in virtfs support.
    Actual helper should come from qemu, and libcap-dev only needed to build it,
    but configure script does not enable virtfs unless -lcap works.
  * build-depend on libusbredirhost-dev, enable network usb redirection
  * depend on seabios >= 1.7.0~, for kvmvapic.bin
  * refreshed debian/patches/resurrect-extboot.diff
  * patches/disable-hpet-for-tcg.patch (taken from Ubuntu) (Closes: #668186)
  * patches/use-libexecdir.patch (+debian/rules) - qemu-bridge-helper is
    in /usr/lib not /usr/libexec.

qemu-kvm (1.0+dfsg-10) unstable; urgency=low

  * add a patch from upstream:
    slirp:-signal-free-input-buffer-space-to-io-thread.patch
    (Closes: #667604)
  * add a forgotten-by-upstream patch to resolve netbsd PCI issues:
    pci-fix-corrupted-pci-conf-index-register-by-unaligned-write.patch
    (Closes: #653473)
  * change package version string format:
     - QEMU emulator version 1.0 (Debian qemu-kvm 1.0+dfsg-9)
     + QEMU emulator version 1.0 (qemu-kvm-1.0+dfsg-10, Debian)
    because libvirt expects to find string " (qemu-kvm-" in the
    version output, and does not enable kvm-specific features
    features if this prefix is not found.  Strictly speaking it
    is libvirt bug, especially in context of qemu and qemu-kvm
    merge, but we'll work around it here.  Only one visible
    result of the "wrong" version number so far is dramatic
    (~20x) reduction of speed of vhost-net-accelerated networking.
    Big thanks to Hans-Kristian Bakke (#668594) for the help in
    debugging this, he provided his machine to me for testing.

  * Force-enable optional features in ./configure args which are listed

    (Closes: #658169)
    Placed all optional features into debian/optional-features file
    instead of hardcoding them in debian/rules, to be able to comment
    on each of them.
    Also rearrange build-deps and sort them alphabetically.
  * Removed debian/gbp.conf (unused)
  * Converted debian/rules to use dh.  Set debian/compat to 8 (and build-depend
    on debhelper >= 8).  This also fixes lintian warnings about missing targets.
  * Added two patches for manpage generation to recognize/use UTF8.

qemu-kvm (0.12.5+dfsg-2) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Michael Tokarev ]
  * patch from upstream: add-support-for-GET-EVENT-STATUS-NOTIFICATION.diff
    (closes: #593144)
  * two patches from upstream qemu/stable-0.12:
    upstream-stable01-make-PIIX-and-ISA-IDE-init-functions-return-the-qdev.diff
    upstream-stable02-fix-CMOS-info-for-drives-defined-with--device.diff
    (closes: #588739)
  * revert-all-bdrv_write_sync-changes.diff - this patch reverts the changes
    which went into 0.12.5 upstream and make all metadata writes (for qcow&Co)
    syncronous.  Yes it's more correct, but the resulting write speed is
    insanely slow and makes all image formats except raw unusable.
    (closes: #594069)

qemu-kvm (0.12.4+dfsg-1) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Michael Tokarev ]
  * New upstream minor/stable release 0.12.4, incorporating
    the following patches:
     avoid_creating_too_large_iovecs_in_multiwrite_merge.patch
     net:-remove-broken-net_set_boot_mask-boot-device-validation.diff
     block:-free-iovec-arrays-allocated-by-multiwrite_merge.diff
     bail-out-when-VCPU_CREATE-fails.diff
  * add madv_mergeable-for-old-kernheaders-hack.diff, mostly
    to help bpo builds (it is to enable KMS even when compiled
    against old kernel headers, when running on recent-enough
    kernel)
  * fix kvm transitional package to have Priority: extra
  * also fix kvm transitional package to properly run with reportbug,
    and simplify the bug-script and use dh_bugfiles to install them.
  * adedd isa-refine-irq-reservations.patch from Gerd Hoffmann
    (closes: #574051)
  * added be_more_specific_in_-mem-path_error_messages.diff trivial 
    patch to be more specific when throwing errors. (closes: #574073)
  * bump debhelper build-depend version to 7.2.3 due to dh_bugfiles.
  * net:-remove-broken-net_set_boot_mask-boot-device-validation.diff
    (to let it to boot from network using new -netdev syntax, cherry-
    picked from stable) (closes: #575628)
  * block:-free-iovec-arrays-allocated-by-multiwrite_merge.diff
    to fix a memory leak in virtio-blk implementation
  * rehash 04_use_etc_kvm_kvm-ifup.patch - apparently the #defines
    are now in two places, remove one of them and patch another
  * bail-out-when-VCPU_CREATE-fails.diff - new patch to make kvm to behave
    a bit nicely if vcpu_create fails: before it were just segfaulting.
    (closes: #558029)

qemu-kvm (0.12.3+dfsg-4) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Michael Tokarev ]
  * added patch from upstream, ff5414990645653bf43bf64adfc1ca77ffb9edcb,
    revert-sdlaudio:-make-it-suck-less.diff (closes: #572943)
    Note that this is only relevant to sdl audio (QEMU_AUDIO_DRV=sdl)
  * don't report system dmi information in the bugreports anymore, it
    serves almost no useful purpose these days, much less than previously.
    VMX/SVM is either enabled or not, and if it is not enabled, kvm module
    will warn user about this fact in dmesg during load.
    (closes: #572930, #572924)
  * switch back to vgabios as shipped in upstream tarball in kvm/vgabios.
    I overlooked it, thinking it went away together with seabios as
    both roms/seabios and roms/vgabios are empty in upstream, but vgabios
    has never been removed.  So we're back at using it.
    Big thanks to Bjørn Mork for the hard work he did finding bugs in the
    version we shipped in 0.12.3+dfsg-2, which is wrong and the work
    should have not been required.  But it helped finding all the pieces
    finally. (closes: #572991)
  * build-depend on linux-libc-dev >= 2.6.32, to enable KSM (Kernel 
    Samepage Merge) and to ensure we'll not have spurious preadv()
    problems
  * build-depend on libaio-dev to compile in aio support
    (which does not do any harm if not explicitly enabled)
  * fix cleanups of old conffiles in preinst. (closes: #573280)
  * include 573439-fail-to-set-hdd-serial-number.diff - a fix by
    Kouichi ONO broken hdd serial number support (closes: #573439)

qemu-kvm (0.12.3+dfsg-3) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Michael Tokarev ]
  * fix number of jobs for seabios build to 1 (-j1)
    or else it breaks parallel builds
  * Ctrl-Alt-f for fullscreen is fixed in 0.12.3 (closes: #559086).
  * added avoid_creating_too_large_iovecs_in_multiwrite_merge.patch
    that fixes spontaneous I/O errors in guests under load.

qemu-kvm (0.12.3+dfsg-2) unstable; urgency=low

qemu-kvm (0.12.3+dfsg-1) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Michael Tokarev ]
  * New Upstream Version 0.12. (closes: #568804)
    (Apparently closes: #570245)
  * update list of files to remove for DFSG,
    and reorganize the procedure a bit
  * add sources for vgabios and seabios as patches from qemu-0.12.3.tar.gz
    (since qemu-kvm-0.12.x.tar.gz does not have them).  For now we can't use
    an external package (#489442) because qemu(-kvm) is too closely tied to
    bios versions and the risk to get a non-working system with external
    packages is still too high.
  * ship kvm transitional package; set version number for it so it will
    be higher than real kvm, and conflict/replace that old kvm in qemu-kvm.
    (closes: #565547)
  * remove some irrelevant patches (10-ksm-support, 07_set_sdl_title,
    09_qemu-fix-qcow2-backing-file-with-virtio,
    from-debian-qemu/22_net_tuntap_stall)
  * remove/backup /etc/init.d/kvm in preinst, so that only one startup
    script will provide kvm service, and also remove other kvm conffile
    leftovers. (closes: #557766)
  * split get-orig-source rule into two (tarball + dfsg)
  * update Standards-Version to 3.8.4 (no changes needed)

  [ Jan Lübbe ]
  * Build-Depend on python for seabios

qemu-kvm (0.11.1+dfsg-1) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Jan Lübbe ]
  * New upstream release
  * Provide kvm from qemu-kvm (closes: #558026)

  [ Michael Tokarev ]
  * clean up kvm/userspace in `clean' target or else the package
    does not build twice in a row (closes: #527371).
    Also add more workarounds to the clean target, namely,
    clean up kvm/user/test/lib from .*.d files and remove
    generated qemu-monitor.texi
  * fix /etc/kvm/kvm-ifup script (missing {} in awk), thanks to
    Andrea Zagli for the fix (closes: #560436)
  * check in /etc/kvm/kvm-ifup that we actually found default route
    interface and that it's actually a bridge
  * handle etherboot-5.4.4 which moved roms from /usr/share/etherboot
    to /usr/lib/etherboot and actually provided virtio boot rom.  Thanks
    to John Morrissey for the fix and patch. (closes: #522179).

  [ Jan Lübbe ]
  * Remove NAME="%k" from udev rule (closes: #559300)
