automake1.13 for Debian
----------------------

Automake 1.13 introduces several changes. It is not strictly backwards
compatible with older versions of automake. It must be used in
conjunction with autoconf 2.60 or greater. Using it with a earlier
version will generate broken Makefiles. Also, it no longer invokes
libtoolize. This job has fallen upon the autoconf utility
`autoreconf'.
