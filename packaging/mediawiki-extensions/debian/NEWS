mediawiki-extensions (2.9) unstable; urgency=low

  The mediawiki-extensions-fckeditor package has been
  deprecated by the Wikimedia foundation and is thus
  no longer included in the packaging, so if your wikis
  have been using this extension, please remove it from
  their configuration to avoid breakage. This can be
  done using "sudo mwdisext FCKeditor.php" if installed
  from Debian packaging.
