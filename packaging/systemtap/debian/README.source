This package uses quilt to manage all modifications to the upstream
source.  Changes are stored in the source package as diffs in
debian/patches and applied during the build.

For more information see /usr/share/doc/quilt/README.source

For packaging of git snapshots it is possible to use script
make-snapshot.sh . It accepts path to the bare upstream git
repository as argument.
