  * Removed dependency on nilsisma (Closes: #294494) 

 -- Corrin Lakeland <lakeland@debian.org>  Fri, 11 Feb 2005 10:15:49 +1300

razor (2.670-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Lots of changes, mostly upstream fixes meaning we need fewer fixes.
  * Upgrade to latest stable release (Closes: #261506)
  * Don't include upstream changelogs in debian changes (Closes: #292181)
  * Fixed typos (Closes: #288558, #281098)
  * RAZOR_HOME is now derived automatically and cannot be manually set.
      The logic for deriving it automatically has been improved so you
        shouldn't see any problems unless they're trying to do something odd.
        I'm going to close the old bug reports about logging to / because 
        I cannot reproduce them at all with this version 
        (Closes: #269723, #262765, #247057)
        This also fixes the potential security concerns with logging to /tmp
        as logging to /tmp should never happen now. (Closes: #292420)
      For all users, the default configuration file is
        /etc/razor/razor-agent.conf unless this file does not exist.
        Any user, including root, can override this default by creating a
        file ~/.razor/razor-agent.conf.  If the latter file exists, then the
        file in /etc will be ignored.   Note that this behaviour is different
        to previous versions of razor.
  * Patches to support tainting have been included upstream and are no longer
      applied specifically for debian.
  * Mentions syslog in man page (Closes: #278981)
  * No known missing dependencies (Closes: #271809) -- reopen if you know any
  * Logcheck from <le-debianbugs@biz.h42.de> is included (Closes #270559).
    It has not been enabled by default mostly because razor does not use
    syslog by default so I'd rather not rotate a log file that probably does
    not exist.
  * Better timeouts when the servers are unavailable.  This still isn't 
    totally fixed but I think it is sufficiently fixed to close the bug
    reports.  To summarise: Networks are unreliable and sometimes cloudmark 
    will be down, but sometimes it is just slow.  Razor waits a while and then
    gives up.  Some programs get impatient and terminate razor while it is
    still waiting.  (Closes: #213227, #176013)
 -- Corrin Lakeland <lakeland@debian.org>  Thu, 10 Feb 2005 08:30:06 +1300

razor (2.610-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * No major changes, mostly clearing out old bug reports.
  * Incomporated upstream change of the default logic method to 5
    instead of 4.  The difference in logic method relates to messages
    with multiple MIME components.  If the method is 4 then any nonspam
    MIME component says the message is nonspam, while method 5 classifies
    components as 'disputed' and resolves based on the rest of the message.

    Using method 4 makes it trivial for spammers to bypass razor (by adding
    a nonspam mime component to every spam) but in the past method 5
    resulted in some valid emails being marked as spam (because they
    included a background picture that was also used in spams.)  Vipul
    believes the problems with method 5 have been resolved and we should
    use the method that is harder to bypass.
  * Source code tweaks to assist with logging (Closes #262765, #269723)
    Thanks to Rene Konasz <oe4@gmx.at>
  * Latest version is now in Debian (Closes #261506)
  * Added a readme explaining how to log via syslog (Closes: #262711)
  * Support for logrotate will not be added; users wanting this should log via
    syslog, which already supports logrotate (Closes: #255937)
  * Revised the readme about razor-register (Closes: #268383)
  * As far as I can see, this leaves one bug outstanding -- when
    razor is unable to access cloudmark it gets unhappy.  This bug is present
    in all versions of razor.  Hopefully it will be fixed one day.

razor (2.610-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream

 -- Corrin Lakeland <lakeland@debian.org>  Sat,  7 Aug 2004 18:01:34 +1200

razor (2.400-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Also reapplied Findlay's patch which prevents razor logging to /
  *   This should be much less important now since people running razor system
  *   wide should probably be using syslog instead of file.
  *   Closing some old bugs related to this (Closes: #153619, #151415)

 -- Corrin Lakeland <lakeland@debian.org>  Sun, 13 Jun 2004 19:44:38 +1200

razor (2.400-2) unstable; urgency=low

  *  First real attempt at fixing tainting issues
  *  Added an extra ugly untaint to Config.pm, specifically
  *  untainting the filename.  I'm not entirely happy about this, but
  *  I can't see any better solutions.  Superficial code analysis implies
  *  it won't add any security holes (it would require the cracker to have
  *  write permission to the system wide configuration file in order to 
  *  hijack razor, and that file should have at least as tight permissions as 
  *  the razor process so a cracker with access to that file won't gain 
  *  much (perhaps another method to add a backdoor for themselves?)

 -- Corrin Lakeland <lakeland@debian.org>  Sun, 30 May 2004 18:14:43 +1200

razor (2.400-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream (quite a big change)
  *
  * Razor now supports syslog! (Lots of you have asked for this)
  *
  * If you are using razor system wide rather than per user, then
  * turn on syslog logging for proper log support, log rotation, etc.
  * Without syslog, razor logs to RAZOR_HOME, which defaults to /tmp.
  * I am not going to change the default RAZOR_HOME to /var/log as one
  * person requested because people that would not work for individual 
  * users (no write permission).
  *
  * I'm going to say that this change closes the bug request for logging
  * to /var/log since syslog provides this (Closes: #240525)
  *
  * Updated the readme, making it clear razor-admin must be run
  * (Closes: #234043)
  *
  * This code now integrates the variable tainting directly, so if it doesn't
  * work for you, please report it as a bug.

 -- Corrin Lakeland <lakeland@debian.org>  Fri, 10 Oct 2003 04:30:28 +0200

razor (2.361-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Changed back to being a debian native package.  Sorry all, stupid mistake
    (Closes: #214579). The orig.tar.gz is from upstream and should match MD5
  * I had to bump the version number in order for it to allow a new release,
    so this is _not_ a new upstream.

 -- Corrin Lakeland <lakeland@debian.org>  Tue,  7 Oct 2003 21:32:40 +0200

razor (2.220-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Upgrade to 2.22 (Closes #170752)
  * Depends on libc6 to make woody backporting safer (Closes: #181115) 
  * Include the man5 directory (Closes: #181035, #163445, #161712)
  * Change default logic method to 5 (Closes: #178470)
  *   There is a serious bug with razor that means an email cotaining 
  *   a MIME part that is known spam is by default considered spam.  There
  *   have been various workarounds but none are working yet.  This decision
  *   makes it trivial to bypass razor but is probably a better temporary
  *   measure than false positives
 -- Corrin Lakeland <lakeland@debian.org>  Mon, 24 Mar 2003 16:06:16 +1200

razor (2.200-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed missing export of PERL5LIB based on patches from several people
  * (Closes: 176011)
  * The timeout problem and a couple others (# 171227) may be fixed,
  * but I'm not confident enough to close the bug report yet

razor (2.200-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream
  * Various fixes suggested by Santiago Vila
  * First steps towards fixing log problems (no bugs closed yet)
  * Note that 2.20 (and before) have a bug relating to MIME handling.
  * This causes them to sometimes tag valid messages as spam.
  * this has been fixed in 2.22 which is considered too unstable to release

razor (2.152-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream
  * Fixed incorrect removal of symlinks which prevented regeneration
  *   (Closes: #162266)
  * Razor no longer auto registers.  For most sites the users are the
  *   ones that report spam so they must register seperatly.  In the case
  *   of single user machines, seeing a debconf question was likely to cause
  *   confusion with the user thinking they had already registered.
  *   If I get any complaints I'll put it back with priorty=low and/or
  *   put a note in.
  * As a side effect this fixes a packaging bug (Closes: #161711)
  * Thanks to new HTML.c this package is now arch:any rather than all.

  * Many fixes from Santiago Vila <sanvila@unex.es> 
  *   Changed "libtime-hires-perl" to "libtime-hires-perl | perl (>= 5.8)"

  *   Changed Provides: to razor2
