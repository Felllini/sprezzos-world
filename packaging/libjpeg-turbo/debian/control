Description: A SIMD-accelerated JPEG codec that provides both the libjpeg and TurboJPEG APIs
 libjpeg-turbo is a derivative of libjpeg that uses SIMD instructions (MMX,
 SSE2, NEON) to accelerate baseline JPEG compression and decompression on x86,
 x86-64, and ARM systems.  On such systems, libjpeg-turbo is generally 2-4x as
 fast as the unmodified version of libjpeg, all else being equal.
 .
 libjpeg-turbo was originally based on libjpeg/SIMD by Miyasaka Masaru, but
 the TigerVNC and VirtualGL projects made numerous enhancements to the codec
 in 2009, including improved support for Mac OS X, 64-bit support, support
 for 32-bit and big-endian pixel formats (RGBX, XBGR, etc.), accelerated
 Huffman encoding/decoding, and various bug fixes.  The goal was to produce a
 fully open-source codec that could replace the partially closed-source
 TurboJPEG/IPP codec used by VirtualGL and TurboVNC.  libjpeg-turbo generally
 achieves 80-120% of the performance of TurboJPEG/IPP.  It is faster in some
 areas but slower in others.
 .
 In early 2010, libjpeg-turbo spun off into its own independent project, with
 the goal of making high-speed JPEG compression/decompression technology
 available to a broader range of users and developers.
