libmpeg3 (1.5.4-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/rules: Added more severe dependencies for mpeg3-utils (closes:
    #242617).

 -- David Martínez Moreno <ender@debian.org>  Sat, 10 Apr 2004 17:31:12 +0200

libmpeg3 (1.5.4-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added #define __USE_LARGEFILE64 in mpeg3private.h for finally resolving

libmpeg3 (1.5.4-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Newly forgot to compile objects for the shared library with fPIC. I did
    read again the 10.2 chapter of the Debian Policy Manual. Good book.
    Everyone should have a copy on their bed table (closes: #241696).
  * Added SOBJS target to main Makefile in order to manage the desired effect,
    also with a .SUFFIXES line for .lo files.
  * Compiled library with -D_REENTRANT (Good 10.2 chapter)...

libmpeg3 (1.5.4-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release (closes: #226699).
  * Removed a52dec and mpeg2dec from the original tarball, as they are
    included in Debian (and btw mpeg2dec isn't used at all in the build).
  * debian/control:
    - Added Build-Depends on liba52dec-dev.
    - I'm stupid (again). I didn't corrected the description that a nice user
      sent to me in #142146. Anyway, it is *in*, now.
    - Bring libmpeg3 from the Pleistocene to modern times. Bumped debhelper
      dependency to >= 4.0.0. Changed debian/compat accordingly.
    - Bumped Standards-Version to 3.6.1. Some changes in DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS,
      and that's all, folks.
    - Finally remembered to move libmpeg3-dev from devel -> libdevel.
  * Cleaned up some bad UTF-8 entries in changelog and control files.
  * debian/rules: Added "version" and "major" variables for building the
    shared library.
  * Finally splitted the software in binary and library packages (closes:
    #145758).

libmpeg3 (1.5-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * The "Fast surikato" release.
  * debian/changelog, debian/control: Recoded into UTF-8, finally.
  * I forgot to fix the -ieee Alpha gcc flag in the previous release. Fixed
    (closes: #204021). Thanks to Guillem for his continuous mails and tireless
    IRC queries... ;-)
  * Added debian/compat (=3). Tightened thus dependency on debhelper >= 3.4.4.

 -- David Martínez Moreno <ender@debian.org>  Fri, 28 Nov 2003 12:45:08 +0100

libmpeg3 (1.5-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * The "Surikato release".
  * Thanks to Guillem Jover for pushing hard for this release.
  * Fixed finally the -fPIC issue (closes: #193993).
  * Fixed many other things, like warnings, specific dependencies specified,
    utilities finally dynamic-linked, and cleaned up the Makefile. Thanks
    again, Guillem.
  * Fixed the description (there's no MPEG-3 standard, really) (closes:
    #142146).

 -- David Martínez Moreno <ender@debian.org>  Tue, 11 Nov 2003 19:47:41 +0100

libmpeg3 (1.5-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Ooops...hppa build failed due to missing fPIC in the shared object
    building...added.

 -- David Martínez Moreno <ender@debian.org>  Fri,  5 Apr 2002 10:26:51 +0200

libmpeg3 (1.5-3) unstable; urgency=medium

  * I don't know what happened. The header files are a complete mess. Oh, I
    see...a typo, slipped in my modifications to the main Makefile; kindly
    spotted by Klaus Ethgen (closes: #140945). Thanks, guy. :o)
  * After thinking, changed back Architecture to any. I think it can't hurt
    us.
  * Cleaned a bit debian/rules.

 -- David Martínez Moreno <ender@debian.org>  Thu,  4 Apr 2002 17:38:56 +0200

libmpeg3 (1.5-2) unstable; urgency=high

  * The 'I was very busy with my vacations and forgot how to package' release.
  * Priority set to high because the previous package simply didn't include
    the shared library (ooops x 10).
  * debian/rules:
    - This package really ships libmpeg3.so.1.5.0 (closes: #140158).
    - Cleaned some things I've left from Christian's diff (more to come).
    - 'Debhelper'ized a lot more.
    - Removed CFLAGS from here and patched the Makefile for using the
      corresponding CFLAGS per architecture. This, with additional massaging
      in the Alpha CFLAGS, finally allows building in Alpha (closes: #140473).
  * debian/control:
    - Removed nasm from Build-Depends because it's only needed for MMX support
      (not set up in the Debian build).
    - Changed Architectures field from 'any' to 'i386 alpha' (missed in
      1.5-1).
    - Changed Description to reflect the inclusion of several utilities in the
      package.
  * Added some documentation in the -dev package.
  * Now libmpeg3 honors DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS.

libmpeg3 (1.5-1) unstable; urgency=high

  * I need to package this because xmovie depends on it (and I was using the
    unofficial packages from Christian Marillat).
  * The priority is due to the fact that xmovie is in incoming since 10 Mar or
    so, and its dependencies cannot be satisfied.
  * Stripped all the CSS code in the original tarball, thus moving this into
    main.
  * I've used much of the work done by Joshua Haberman and Christian Marillat.
    Thank you, guys.
  * debian/rules: Used the one from Christian with little changes. I'd like to
    change it completely to DHv3, but I want to release this as soon as
    possible.
