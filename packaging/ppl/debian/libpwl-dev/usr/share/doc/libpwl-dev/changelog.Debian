      libpwl5

    on alpha. (this will change when graphite will be used by default in GCC).
  * debian/patches/exception_tests_alpha: Remove.

 -- Arthur Loiret <aloiret@debian.org>  Mon, 11 May 2009 22:08:57 +0000

ppl (0.10.1~pre13-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream snapshot.
    - Dropped patch for bigendian issues.
  * urgency=medium because of FTBFS workaround.
  * Disabled more tests on alpha - exception handling is utterly broken on
    alpha, which will also affect users of PPL on that architecture (probably
    GCC PR 8966) as raised exception cause immediate aborts.
  * Re-enabled Build-Depends-Indep and adapted rules accordingly.
    Closes: #517659.
  * Bumped Standars-Version to 3.8.1 (no changes).
  * Updated copyright information for several files that had been added in
    0.10 and also have a specific license.
  * Added comments to quilt patch (thanks lintian).
  * Added one sentence explaining the difference between libpwl4 und
    libpwl-dev (thanks lintian).
  * Dropped the ChangeLog hackery using symlinks, the ChangeLog is pretty
    small nowadays.
  * Moved pwl.hh to libpwl-dev package.
