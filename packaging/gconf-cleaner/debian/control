Description: GConf database cleaner
 GConf Cleaner is a tool to clean your GConf database up that
 is possibly cluttered with unnecessary or invalid keys.
 .
 This tools scans the user's GConf database and lists the keys that are not
 associated with a schema (i.e. they are likely no longer useful). Then it
 allows the user to backup these keys and remove them from the database.
