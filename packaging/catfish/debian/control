Description: file search tool that support several different engines
 A file search tool using different backends which is configurable via 
 the command line.
 .
 This program acts as a frontend for different file search engines. 
 The interface is intentionally lightweight and simple. But it takes
 configuration options from the command line.
 .
 Currently find, locate, tracker, strigi, pinot, and beagle are
 supported as backends.
