virtuoso-opensource (6.1.4+dfsg1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release (Closes: #650281).
  * Switch to source format 3.0 (quilt).
  * Update patches:
    - drop fix-wide-char-encoding.patch, applied upstream.
    - update repack-zlib.patch.
    - refresh other patches in order to make them apply without any offset.
    - add ignore-netstat-failure.patch, to avoid FTBFS on various
      architectures, thanks to Steven Chamberlain (Closes: #663010).
  * Bump debhelper compatibility level to 9.
  * Build also with LDFLAGS provided by dpkg-buildflags. Doing this with the
    debhelper compatibility level set to 9 should enable all the default
    hardening flags.
  * Bump build dependency on cli-common-dev to (>= 0.8~).
  * Bump Standards-Version to 3.9.3:
    - moved virtuoso-opensource, virtuoso-server and virtuoso-minimal to the
      new "metapackages" section.
  * Metapackages now have versioned Depends (>= ${binary:Version}) against
    other virtuoso packages.
  * Fix a bug in the init script, now uses start-stop-daemon with "--user",
    this makes the script work when you are running it under Plasma (the KDE
    workspace) with Nepomuk, which may already execute a /usr/bin/virtuoso-t
    process making start-stop-daemon fail.
  * The init script now removes the pid file when you stop the process, thus it
    won't kill innocent processes with unfortunate pids when restarting.
  * /etc/virtuoso-opensource-6.1/virtuoso.ini isn't a conffile anymore, it's
    just handled by maintainer scripts (Closes: #656087).
  * Now virtuoso-opensource-6.1.postrm stops the server.
  * Add README.source explaining how the upstream tarball repacking was done.
    Just for the record the zlib removal is handled different compared to
    previous versions of this package, hence why repack-zlib.patch was updated.
  * Fix Vcs-Browser field, now points to a valid URL.
  * Changes in debian/copyright:
    - remove pcre information since it's removed with the repackaging.
    - remove the "Virtuoso may be linked against..." statements.
    - remove various duplicated mentions about SHA/MD5 Javascript routines.
    - remove "DocBk XML" part, since looks like the file(s) involved aren't
      there anymore.
    - extend information about works from the GNU C Library.
    - add the license for a couple of DocBook DTD's.
    - add Minizip and Info-ZIP licenses.
    - mention the files involved in each license statement from other projects.
    - add myself to the copyright holders for the debian packaging.
  * Add debian/not-installed.
  * Install README.UPGRADE.
  * Add pt_BR debconf translation (Closes: #649152).
  * Update debian/TODO.Debian:
    - remove explanation about broken parallel building, right now looks like
      the problem is just gone.
  * Set myself as maintainer since looks like Obey Arthur Liu is MIA. Arthur,
    you are very wellcomed to come back.
  * Enable the DM-Upload-Allowed flag.
