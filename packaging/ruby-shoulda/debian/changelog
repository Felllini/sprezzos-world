ruby-shoulda (3.0.0~beta2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
    + Package was split by upstream. Most code was moved to
      ruby-shoulda-matchers and ruby-shoulda-context, and this package is now a
      thin convenience package that loads these two.
  * Rename main package to ruby-shoulda and migrate packaging to gem2deb.
