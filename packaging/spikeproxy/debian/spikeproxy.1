.SH NAME
spikeproxy \- web application auditing tool
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B spkproxy
.B [-s SSLproxyhost] [-p port] [-U NTLMUser] [-D NTLMDomain] [-P NTLMPassword] 
.B [-l ListenHost] [-c cache_directory]
.SH DESCRIPTION
This manual page documents briefly the
.B spikeproxy
command.
This manual page was written for the Debian distribution
because the original program does not have a manual page.
.PP
SPIKE proXY functions as an HTTP and HTTPS proxy, and allows 
web developers or web application auditors low level access to 
the entire web application interface, while also providing a 
number  of automated tools and techniques for discovering common
problems. These automated tools include:

1.Automated SQL Injection Detection

2.Web Site Crawling (guaranteed not to crawl sites other than the one being tested)

3.Login form brute forcing

4.Automated overflow detection

5.Automated directory traversal detection

.PP
In addition to automated analysis, SPIKE proXy allows the user to 
penetrate into the internals of the web application by viewing and 
changing all variables, cookies, headers, or other parts of the request 
and resubmit them. SPIKE proXy maintains a careful record of each request 
made - saving both each request, and the entire response. The user can 
later go back and replace any request or view any response.
.SH OPTIONS
This program can be configured with the options listed below.
The options may be given in any order.
.TP
\-c cache directory
The directory that will be used to cache all the requests. This directory
is created if it does not exist. The default location is
.B /var/cache/spikeproxy
but it can only be used by the \fBroot\fR user.
\-l listenhost
The IP address the proxy will listen on (it defaults to 127.0.0.1 so it
is not available from external hosts).
.TP
\-p port
This option sets the port the proxy will listen on (it defaults to 8080 if not
provided).
.TP
\-h proxyHost 
Sets a proxy host to use in the proxy chain.  Spike will forward all requests
to this proxy.
.TP
\-H proxyPort 
Sets the port for the proxy host.
.TP
\-s proxySSLHost 
Sets a proxy host for SSL connections. Spike will forward all SSL requests
to this proxy.
.TP
\-S proxySSLPort
Sets the port for the SSL proxy host.
.TP
\-U NTLM Username
Defines the NTLM username it will use when authenticating to the proxy host.
.TP

Sets the password it will use when authenticating to the proxy host.
.TP
\-D NTLM Domain
Sets the NTLM domain it will use when providing credentials to the proxy host.

connected to it through a web client. If you are trying to audit a 
web application you might want to read
