spkproxy (1.4.8-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Acknowledge NMU, thanks Ana for the patch. (Closes: #380960)
  * Package rebuild makes it depend on python version 2.4 (Closes: #385390)
  * Add a new -c option to define the proxy's cache for users, this makes
    it easier to define an alternate location for cachedir so that
    administrators do not have to fiddle with the permissions of 
    /var/cache/spikeproxy
  * Introduce all the options into the manpage, including the new -c option.
    (it previously said there was only one option, which is no longer true)
  * Introduce a new function in spikeProxyUI.py to setCache() that checks
    if the cache directory exists and is writable. Previously it will only
    check if it existed and would not complain about it not being writable
    until you browsed through the proxy. This makes the error message
    of the cachedir not being useful for the user appear as soon as the
    program startups.
  * Remove all compile Python files under ntlm/. This makes it possible
    to rebuild the package after running spikeproxy locally (within
    package sources)

spkproxy (1.4.8-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Do some error interception with respect of the cache dir.
    Also, add a symlink from /usr/share/spikeproxy/cache to
    /var/cache/spikeproxy/. I'm doing this after Ubuntu
    improperly fixed a bug (Malone: #3397) which nobody 
    forwarded to me. And still the reporter said that I'm not responding,
    go figure.
  * Have spikeproxy intercept the error when trying to create 
    cache directories under /var/cache/spikeproxy/ and print some
    additional information (point users to README.Debian!)
  * Add some more information in README.Debian on how to setup
    spikeproxy and why the default is the way it is.
