Description: Web application security testing proxy
 SPIKE proXy is part of the SPIKE Application Testing Suite, 
 It functions as an HTTP and HTTPS proxy, and allows the web developer
 or web application auditor low level access to the entire web application 
 interface, while also providing a bevy of automated tools and techniques 
 for discovering common problems. These automated tools include:
 .
  - Automated SQL Injection Detection
  - Web Site Crawling (guaranteed not to crawl sites other than 
    the one being tested)
  - Login form brute forcing
  - Automated overflow detection
  - Automated directory traversal detection
 . 
 In addition to automated analysis, SPIKE proXy allows the user to 
 analyse the internals of the web application by viewing and changing 
 all variables, cookies, headers, or other parts of the request and 
 resubmit them. Also, a single installation can be shared by multiple users.
