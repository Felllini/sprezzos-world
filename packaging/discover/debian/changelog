discover (2.0.7-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Apply patches from Rafael Avila de Espindola (rafael.espindola
    at gmail dot com) to fix some memory leaks.
  * Inspired by Rafael: handle /proc more safely in Linux ATA sysdeps.
  * Inspired by Rafael: check that we could open the configuration
    directory, and close it when we're done.
  * Apply include file fixes to the test suite.
  * Disable curl support in the Debian packages.  Closes: #279462.
  * Purge -o from tests and use grep -E instead of egrep.
    Closes: #258314.
  * Fix wrong paths in documentation.  Closes: #273205.
  * Fix discover-config documentation to match the utility
    (actually a fix to buildtools).  Closes: #247546.
  * Include string.h in sysdeps/linux/ata.c, so we don't get
    weird pointer arithmetic going.
  * Make sure that our device ordering matches whether we read
    PCI device info from /proc or /sys.  Closes: #286552.
  * Trimmed unneeded Build-Depends.
  * Fix package build issues with static linking and stripping
    of binaries.

discover (2.0.6-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Do not modify /etc/discover-modprobe.conf with data migrated from

    may cause problems for people who had set discover v1 to skip modules,
    but the solution violates Debian policy.  Users are encouraged to
    migrate their discover v1 configuration by hand.  Closes: #283070.

discover (2.0.6-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Ian Murdock <imurdock@progeny.com>:

  * Call update-rc.d remove in postrm on purge, not remove.
    Closes: #252634.

  * Use /var/lib for crash data rather than /var/state, as per FHS.
    Closes: #273205.

  * Allow data query operations (i.e., --data-path and
    --data-version) even when the device type is not specified.
    This mirrors the default behavior of Discover in version 1 and
    is consistent with the results of invoking Discover without
    any arguments (which displays a summary of all device detected).

  * discover-modprobe.conf: Specify the empty string for types, so the
    default behavior is to report on all detected hardware.

  * Allow data query operations (i.e., --data-path and
    --data-version) to take a device ID (that is, a vendor ID and a
    model ID concatenated together, e.g., "0x05af080a") in addition to a
    device type. This is in preparation for adding hotplug support.

  * sysdeps/linux/pci.c: Convert device class to little-endian
    byte order on big-endian architectures. Patch
    from Rafael EspÃ­ndola <rafael.espindola at ic.unicamp.br>.
    Closes: #255868.

  * Jeff Licquia <licquia@progeny.com>:

  * Instead of a single discover.conf, move to use a discover.conf.d
    directory with multiple configuration files.  This allows other
    packages to change discover's configuration, and eliminates the
    problem with /etc/discover.conf changing formats.
    Closes: #256473.

  * Add a new configuration attribute to the data-source element in
    configuration files: "place".  If set to "before", the data in
    the source is prepended instead of appended, making it override
    the default data.

  * Build-Dep on libcurl3-dev as the default curl.  Closes: #260205.

discover (2.0.2-0.0.0.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * The following changes are by Eric Gillespie <epg@progeny.com>.

  * discover/lib/load-url.c
      (_discover_load_url_file): Fix url parsing.

  * discover/tests/device.c
      (device_test_internals): Revert previous change.  "Tiny editorial
        corrections" broke this test.

  * discover/tests/data/pci-vendor.xml
      Revert previous change, another editorial change that broke a test.

  * discover/discover/{didiscover.c,discover.c},
    discover/doc/GNUmakefile,
    discover/tests/data/usb-vendor.xml
      Last of the reversions.

  * discover/configure.ac
      Put a comment back with the code it documented, which moved when curl
      was made optional.

  * discover/lib/Makefile.in
      Comment out the only libdiscover_pic.a references left uncommented.
      Also nitpick a couple of the others.

  * discover/discover/discover.c
      Remove extraneous newlines added to usage and help output in 1.51,
      which fixed my line-spanning strings (older gcc versions ruined me!).

  * discover/configure.ac
      I thought AC_PATH_TOOL honored tools set in the environment, but it
      doesn't.  Maybe it did in an older version of autoconf.  At any rate,
      explicitly look for tools in the environment before looking for them
      with AC_PATH_TOOL.

  * discover/debian/control
      whitespace police

  * discover/discover/discover.c
      (query_data): Fix printing of extraneous newline when data is empty.

  * discover/discover/Makefile.in
    discover/discover/didiscover.c
      Remove didiscover.c.  The effects of
        didiscover --data-path --data-vendor
        didiscover --data-path --data-model
      are achieved with
        discover -t --no-model
        discover -t --no-vendor

  * discover/debian/rules
      Configure and build discover twice: first a full build for the debs,
      second a no-curl no-shared build for the udeb.

  * discover/lib/{load-url.c,curl.c}
      curl.c:
          Drop the dlopen stuff.  Wrap the entire file in a HAVE_LIBCURL
          conditional.
          (_discover_curl_init): Remove.
          (_discover_load_url_curl): Rename to _discover_load_url.
      load-url.c:
          Move <config.h> to the top where it belongs.  Wrap the entire file
          in a !HAVE_LIBCURL conditional.
          (_discover_load_url): Remove this function which called
          _discover_load_url_curl or _discover_load_url_file; now we just
          provide the same _discover_load_url in both curl and non-curl
          versions.

  * discover/lib/Makefile.in
      Remove GNUisms and put the curl files back into the build, now that
      they properly handle the no-curl case.

  * The following changes are by Branden Robinson <branden@progeny.com>.

  * Development moved back to Progeny CVS; because of this and the now-useful
    "upstream" ChangeLog, this is the last release where the Debian changelog
    file will go into excruciating detail.  Instead, the Debian changelog will
    be used mostly for the bug auto-closing feature (an explanation will
    accompany the auto-closed bugs, of course).

  * discover/ChangeLog: made this file useful with cvs2cl (Closes: #142046)
  * discover/discover.8: add information about how to report unrecognized
    hardware data to maintainers (Closes: #137522)
  * discover/discover.init:
    - load init script's configuration parameters from /etc/default/discover
      if the file is readable
    - only update /dev/cdrom* and corresponding mount points if
      $MANAGE_CDROM_DEVICES is true (corresponds to debconf template)
      (Closes: #118760)
    - use -p argument to mkdir in case parent directories of mount points do
      not exist
    - use $CDROM_BASE_MOUNTPOINT as prefix to mount points
    - implement more precise check for mounted /initrd filesystem
    - migrate from /var/state to /var/lib per FHS (Closes: #136992)
    - added comments describing the function of each of the three
      configuration files

  * debian/control:
    - change maintainer to Progeny Debian Packaging Team
    - add Uploaders: field
    - new package: libdiscover1-pic (thanks, Tollef Fog Heen)
      (Closes: #143871)
    - libdiscover-dev Replaces: libdiscover0, libdiscover0-dev
    - discover Depends: debconf (>> 0.5)
  * debian/copyright: corrected URL to package source
  * debian/discover.dirs: /var/state/discover -> /var/lib/discover
  * debian/discover.postinst:
    - discover's rcS.d script needs to run after hotplug's (S35), but before
      networking is set up (S39).  It's getting to be a tight squeeze here.  Run
      it at S36.  (Closes: #143329)
    - manage /etc/default/discover file with debconf, and write debconf
      section containing values of discover/manage_cdrom_devices and
      discover/cdrom_base_mountpoint templates
  * debian/discover.postrm: remove configuration files on package purge
  * debian/discover.templates.pt_BR: added Brazilian Portuguese template
    translations (thanks, Andre Luis Lopes) (Closes: #141526)
  * debian/docs: Stop shipping outdated and misleading Mandrake README and
    BUGS files, and do ship ChangeLog.mandrake.
  * debian/rules:
    - Comment out useless call to dh_installinit.  We don't want to get into
      trouble if it suddenly starts working.  See Debian bug #140881.
    - build libdiscover1-pic (thanks, Tollef Fog Heen)
    - add dh_installdebconf to binary-arch rule
  * debian/shlibs: remove unused file (see libdiscover1.shlibs for the real
    thing)

discover (0.9.15) unstable; urgency=low

  * changes to discover.c:
    - change return_xserver() and return_xdriver() functions; issue a warning,
      not a fatal error, in the event that we cannot parse the X server and/or
      driver that we get back from libdetect (this works around what I feel is
      brain damage in libdetect); also, return the string "unknown" when X
      servers or drivers are requested for such cards; the X server config
      scripts will recognize this and do the right thing
    - tabs -> 8 spaces
    - added vim modeline

discover (0.9.10) unstable; urgency=low

  * Hard-coded a special case: add ide-scsi as a SCSI driver if IDE CD-ROM
    drives are present.  This way, all CD-ROMS will be treated as SCSI,
    and burners will work out of the box.
  * Fixed up the init script so /dev/cdromX (X is a number) files are
    created when files are detected, one for each detected CD drive.
  * Finished up man pages, and set them to be installed.
  * Modules that crash the system are now written to
    /etc/discover-autoskip.conf, instead of /etc/discover.conf.  This is
    more in line with Debian policy, and ensures that autoskip information
    isn't lost when the conffile /etc/discover.conf is updates upstream.
  * Added libisapnp-dev to Build-Depends.

    --model replaces --print-model and takes no arguments; --module
    replaces --print-module and takes no arguments; --device replaces
    --print-device and takes no arguments; --xdriver replaces
    --print-xdriver and takes no arguments; --xserver replaces
    --print-xserver and takes no arguments; a new option, --format,
    takes a printf-style string and formats the output accordingly; and
    arguments separate from any of the options specify which device
    types to operate on (bridge, cdrom, ethernet, ide, scsi, sound, usb,

discover (0.9.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Reenabled pcmcia and bridge scans, now that pcmcia-cs no longer tries
    to load modules manually when discover is present.
  * Added /etc/discover.conf, which specifies hardware detection settings.
  * /etc/init.d/discover: Keep track of which module is being loaded (by
    writing a file to /var/state/discover/crash), and add an appropriate
    "skip" line to discover.conf if the system crashed trying to load it.
  * Moved the discover binary to /lib/discover/discover and added a shell
    script wrapper script /sbin/discover which parses /etc/discover.conf.
  * Moved all configuration information into /etc/discover.conf.

discover (0.9.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added better description to control file.
  * Fixed typo in linuxrc.

 -- Ian Murdock <imurdock@progeny.com>  Mon, 30 Oct 2000 22:45:26 -0500

discover (0.9.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * As of 0.9.2, discover only *reports* information about the
    hardware--it no longer does anything with it.  The *caller* is
    now expected to perform any actions given the information reported,
    such as loading modules.  This allows us to do most of the work
    in scripts, creating fewer opportunities for bugs to crop up,
    and allowing for greater flexibility in how discover gets used.
  * Added `--print-vendor', `--print-model', `--print-device',
    `--print-driver', `--print-module', and `--print-server'.
  * Removed `--load' and `--no-load' options, since discover no longer
    loads modules.
  * Disable ISA probes by default for now.
  * Added echo to busybox Config.h.
  * busybox's sh doesn't seem to have any looping constructs, so for now,
    we copy in ash to serve as /bin/sh.
  * /etc/init.d/discover now loads the modules for detected hardware and
    creates /dev/cdrom.
  * /etc/init.d/discover now checks to make sure the ramdisk is mounted
    before trying to umount it.

discover (0.9.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Restructured to work like libdetect's report program: We now only
    load the specific types of modules the user is interested in rather
    than trying to load every module found during the PCI scan.  This
    should fix the problems where discover was trying to load modules
    twice.
  * Scan each bus individually rather than calling bus_scan().  This
    allows us to selectively disable any of the bus scans.
  * Added a bevy of options.  The most useful are `--disable', `--enable',
    `--disable-all', and `--enable-all'.  These allow potentially
    dangerous scans (e.g., ISA) to be disabled on systems that don't need
    them.  They also allow us to minimize the number of scans done in
    the first stage (e.g., discover --disable-all --enable=pci,ide,scsi),
    which speeds up the boot process significantly.
  * update-initrd: Use /usr/share/detect/*.lst to pull in the modules that
    could potentially be loaded during the first stage rather than pulling
    in arbitrary modules by hand.
  * Added /sbin/modprobe and a minimal /etc/modules.conf to the ramdisk,
    so that kmod doesn't fail on SCSI-only systems trying to load block-
    major-8.  This needs to be generalized, but this quick fix at least
    allows us to work on SCSI systems now.
  * Disabled parallel port scan.  This caused a kernel panic on my Toshiba
    Satellite 2180CDT.  Disabled serial port scan as well, since I'm a bit
    dubious about doing that too.
  * Disabled pcmcia and bridge scans.  These cause the PCMCIA modules to
    be loaded.  That's not necessarily bad, but before we can do that,
    we'll need to coordinate with the PCMCIA packages to make sure we're
    not stepping on any toes.

discover (0.9-16) unstable; urgency=low

  * Now checks for existance of a module properly before doing an insmod
    (or printing that the hardware was detected..)
  * cosmetic fixes

 -- Joseph Carter <knghtbrd@progeny.com>  Thu, 26 Oct 2000 14:59:48 -0500

discover (0.9-15) unstable; urgency=low

  * update-initrd and mkinstalldisks now depmod the ramdisk kernel
  * some of the debug output from mkinstalldisks has been removed
  * modules should no longer be loaded again if they're already loaded
  * modules not found in stage 1 will not cause an error message to be
    printed.  For our purposes, missing modules in stage 1 is correct
    behavior and should fail quietly.
  * fixed some bugs lintian pointed out
  * Only one error message in stage 1 remains - the kernel's spitting it
    out.  The problem is likely in the /linuxrc patch

 -- Joseph Carter <knghtbrd@progeny.com>  Wed, 25 Oct 2000 13:08:49 -0500

discover (0.9-14) unstable; urgency=low

  * Disabled PCMCIA probing per Ian's request
  * Disabled USB probing because it doesn't work
  * Don't create /var/state/discover/rodents - there's nothing in it, ever

 -- Joseph Carter <knghtbrd@progeny.com>  Tue, 24 Oct 2000 20:54:09 -0500

discover (0.9-13) unstable; urgency=low

  * Disabled /proc/bus/usb since our kernel doesn't have usbcore compiled
    in.  libdetect doesn't support probing it at the moment anyway.
  * Now outputs before ISA probes so you don't think your system just froze.
  * Package now includes /etc/discover directory
  * Fixed init script override bug - crash recovery in discover's second
    stage now WORKS.
  * Wrote a package description

 -- Joseph Carter <knghtbrd@progeny.com>  Tue, 24 Oct 2000 19:15:35 -0500

discover (0.9-12) unstable; urgency=low

  * Don't fail to install if postinst can't run update-initrd, just tell
    the user calmly that they have to fix it and run update-initrd on
    their own.  Note, update-initrd should NOT be modified to support non-
    kernel-package kernels because of the necessary patch to make booting
    /linuxrc actually work as documented.

 -- Joseph Carter <knghtbrd@progeny.com>  Tue, 24 Oct 2000 15:20:54 -0500

discover (0.9-11) unstable; urgency=low

  * dontload file now works properly
  * tried moving setvbuf to get unbuffered output - doesn't work

 -- Joseph Carter <knghtbrd@progeny.com>  Mon, 23 Oct 2000 03:14:46 -0500

discover (0.9-10) unstable; urgency=low

  * update-initrd no longer spits out debug output (ie, no more mke2fs is
    shown in package postinst to scare people...)
  * Neither does mkinstalldisks
  * Fixed dependencies

 -- Joseph Carter <knghtbrd@progeny.com>  Thu, 19 Oct 2000 17:49:32 -0500

discover (0.9-9) unstable; urgency=low

  * A little more work on the install disk script, fixed annoying bug

 -- Joseph Carter <knghtbrd@progeny.com>  Wed, 18 Oct 2000 11:01:22 -0500

discover (0.9-8) unstable; urgency=low

  * insmod should no longer ever print out anything, ever, period.

 -- Joseph Carter <knghtbrd@progeny.com>  Mon, 16 Oct 2000 15:36:36 -0500

discover (0.9-7) unstable; urgency=low

  * Changed the style of the output for discover, fflush and setvbuf didn't
    have the desired effect, will look at it more later
  * new script: mkinstalldisks - makes a two-floppy ramdisk image.  The
    first is compressed and mounts the way you'd expect when you set it
    up with grub.  The second is mounted only if your cdrom can't be found
    (it's not compressed, just dd it to a floppy..)  Note, I didn't have a
    chance to test this on a SCSI system, but the script is pretty simple.
    The second floppy is FULL, if there are any ancient and rare SCSI
    modules that can be removed, we should remove them.  I'd appreciate it
    if someone more knowledgable than I about SCSI cards could build a list
    of these.

discover (0.9-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * symlink busybox to umount
  * remove block modules from ramdisk to try and save space

 -- Joseph Carter <knghtbrd@progeny.com>  Wed, 11 Oct 2000 14:12:28 -0500

discover (0.9-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * New cmdline option, nodevcdrom - disables removal and recreation of
    /dev/cdrom symlink
  * New cmdline option, dryrun - just detects and prints stuff to screen
  * Mount /proc/bus/usb in ramdisk
  * Added a very stripped down busybox to replace GNU utils on the ramdisk,
    can expand this if necessary to include more than it currently does.
  * Add modules.dep to ramdisk
  * Use /dev/ram0, not /dev/ram
  * Made umounting of /dev/ram0 quiet
  * Removed some already tested debugging cruft for smaller code size
  * Make a ramdisk for the current kernel - NOTE this COULD break if you do
    something you shouldn't.
  * Implemented a modprobe replacement in discover

 -- Joseph Carter <knghtbrd@progeny.com>  Thu,  5 Oct 2000 16:36:58 -0500

discover (0.9-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Somehow update-initrd didn't get in here - it's in /sbin now

 -- Joseph Carter <knghtbrd@progeny.com>  Wed,  4 Oct 2000 13:15:30 -0500

discover (0.9-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Make discover not run in postinst

 -- Joseph Carter <knghtbrd@progeny.com>  Wed,  4 Oct 2000 12:55:27 -0500

discover (0.9-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Debhelper v2
  * Moved stage two's init script from S46 to S36 (typo on my part)

 -- Joseph Carter <knghtbrd@progeny.com>  Wed,  4 Oct 2000 11:28:52 -0500

discover (0.9-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Initial Release.
