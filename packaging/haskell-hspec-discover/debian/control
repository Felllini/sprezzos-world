Description: behavior-driven development for Haskell
 hspec-discover is roughly based on the Ruby library RSpec. However,
 hspec-discover is just a framework for running HUnit and QuickCheck tests.
 Compared to other options, it provides a much nicer syntax that makes tests
 very easy to read.
 .
 This package provides a library for the Haskell programming language.
 See http://www.haskell.org/ for more information on Haskell.
