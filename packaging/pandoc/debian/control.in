Description: general markup converter
 Pandoc is a Haskell library for converting from one markup format to
 another, and a command-line tool that uses this library. It can read
 markdown and (subsets of) reStructuredText, HTML, LaTeX and DocBook
 XML; and it can write plain text, markdown, reStructuredText, XHTML,
 HTML 5, LaTeX (including beamer slide shows), ConTeXt, RTF, DocBook
 XML, OpenDocument XML, ODT, Word docx, GNU Texinfo, MediaWiki markup,
 EPUB, Textile, groff man pages, Emacs Org-Mode, AsciiDoc, and Slidy,
 Slideous, DZSlides, or S5 HTML slide shows. It can also produce PDF
 output on systems where LaTeX is installed.
 .
 Pandoc's enhanced version of markdown includes syntax for footnotes,
 tables, flexible ordered lists, definition lists, delimited code
 blocks, superscript, subscript, strikeout, title blocks, automatic
 tables of contents, embedded LaTeX math, citations, and markdown inside
 HTML block elements.  (These enhancements can optionally be disabled.)
 .
 In contrast to most existing tools for converting markdown to HTML,
 which use regex substitutions, Pandoc has a modular design: it consists
 of a set of readers, which parse text in a given format and produce a
 native representation of the document, and a set of writers, which
 convert this native representation into a target format. Thus, adding
 an input or output format requires only adding a reader or writer.
 .
 This package contains the pandoc tool.
 .
 PDF output via PDFLaTeX requires the package texlive-latex-recommended,
 via XeLaTeX it additionally requires texlive-xetex, and via LuaTeX
 additionally texlive-luatex.
