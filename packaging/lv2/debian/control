Description: LV2 audio plugin specification
 LV2 is a simple but extensible successor of LADSPA plugins,
 intended to address the limitations of LADSPA which many

 .
 This package contains the LV2 audio plugin specification,
 with all the official extension packages, as well as example
 plugins, lv2specgen, and additional data.
 .
 Implementations are encouraged to abandon the “copy paste
