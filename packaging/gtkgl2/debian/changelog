gtkgl2 (2.0.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New maintainer (with permission from the QA team: more than 4 years
    since the last maintainer upload; also, I now maintain this upstream).

gtkgl2 (1.99.0-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Ack NMU (closes nothing.  I'm getting tired of people doing NMUs without
    sending NMU patches, you know?)
  * debian/control: add libglu-dev to build dependencies (closes: bug#192559)

gtkgl2 (1.99.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Pulled new upstream version from CVS
  * debian/rules: clean horrible horrible packaging
  * debian/rules, debian/compat: use debhelper 4
  * debian/control: rename packages to libgtkgl2.0-dev and libgtkgl2.0-1
    This breaks packages that depend on gtkglarea.  Rename source package to
    gtkgl2.  If everything (relevant) in woody+1 is moved to GNOME 2 in
    time, gtkglarea should be removed from the distribution.

gtkglarea (1.2.3-1) unstable; urgency=low

gtkglarea (1.2.2-7) unstable; urgency=low

  * configure.in: change version info to 5:0:0.  Whoever figures this
    one out gets a cookie from me.  After diff'ing arround in CVS,
    AFAICS what happened was this: upstream version 1.2.1's configure
    script read 4:0:0, 1.2.2's read 5:0:0, but (and this is the killer
    bug) 1.2.1's configure.in read 4:0:0 whilst 1.2.2 read 5:0:1.
    Upstream probably realized he had made a mistake, corrected it in
    the configure.in but the released sources still contained 5:0:0,
    making the soname version 5 instead of 4.  Since released sources
    are mandatory in this case, methinks upstream should make the same
    change.  Sent upstream.  (closes: bug#107502, bug#108045)
