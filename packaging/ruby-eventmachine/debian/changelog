  * New upstream release. (Closes: #577102)
  * debian/control: 
    - Bumped up Standards-Version to 3.8.4.
  * debian/watch:
    - The upstream seems to only distribute a gem package, no longer in the
    *.tar.gz format. The watch file watches versions of gem packages.  Thanks
    to Frederic Peters for letting me know.
