udisks (1.0.4-7) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/patches/13-dosfslabel.patch: The original reasons why mlabel was
    preferred over dosfslabel are no longer true. So switch back to dosfslabel
    which is part of dosfstools which we already require for mkfs.vfat and
    drop the Recommends on mtools. Fix the maximum length for FAT labels while
    at it. (Closes: #680683)

udisks (1.0.4-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/control: Drop ntfsprogs recommendation, it's now a transitional
    package. ntfs-3g provides the programs now.
  * Add debian/patches/00git_media_card_device_tags.patch: Mark MemStick and

udisks (1.0.4-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Drop debian/patches/01-mkfs-tempdir.patch: udisks-daemon now creates
    /var/run/udisks on demand, so this patch is obsolete.
  * Refresh debian/patches/02-defer_smart_probing.patch.
  * Bump debhelper compatibility level to 8.

 -- Michael Biebl <biebl@debian.org>  Tue, 30 Aug 2011 00:51:54 +0200

udisks (1.0.3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
    - Recognize Realtek PCI card reader. (LP: #759963)
    - Stop polling CD drives with udev >= 172 (soon to be released), which
      will enable in-kernel polling. With older udevs, this bug is "wontfix".
      (Closes: #576954)
  * Drop 00git-sd-card-id.patch, 00git-udf-permissions.patch,
    11-remove-unused-probers.patch: Applied upstream.
  * Drop 10-ide-cd-support.patch. ide-cd is dead; squeeze already uses libata.
  * debian/copyright: Add missing "Format:" header.
  * debian/control: Drop libpolkit-backend-1-dev build dependency, not
    required by this upstream version any more.
  * debian/udisks.install: Drop polkit extension, not built by this version

    UDF when they are on readonly CD media. (LP: #635499)
  * debian/control: Improve package description. Thanks Justin B Rye!
    (Closes: #614146)
  * debian/control: Explain in the package description why udisks
    recommends/suggests file system creation/admin tools. (Closes: #595114)
  * Activate support for udisks-tcp-bridge. Note that this is purely
    convenience and does not enable extra privileges (can do the same with ssh
    and dbus-send). This unbreaks the "Connect to server.." functionality in
    gnome-disk-utility. (LP: #568926)
    - debian/rules: Drop --disable-remote-access.
    - debian/udisks.install: Install Avahi service description file.

  * debian/control: Bump libpolkit dependencies, as per new upstream
    configure.
  * 10-ide-cd-support.patch: Add explicit linking to libudev, as this patch
    introduces udev_* calls. Fixes linking with gcc 4.5.
  * debian/rules: Use dpkg-vendor instead of lsb_release. Drop lsb-release
    build dependency.

udisks (1.0.1+git20100614-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add 00git-fix-luks-forced-removal.patch: In the event of the forced
    removal of a crypto device, use the luks_holder property since it is still
    available to figure out which underlying cleartext LUKS device to
    teardown, instead of scanning through all available devices (because the
    cleartext device already has had its properties cleaned up). Many thanks
    to Mathieu Trudel for the patch! Patch cherrypicked from upstream git
    trunk. (LP: #484429)

udisks (1.0.1+git20100614-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/udisks.postinst
    - Query D-Bus to find out the correct pid of the process claiming
      org.freedesktop.UDisks. This way we do not accidentally kill the
      wrong process when being installed in a chroot. (Closes: #593195)
  * debian/udisks.prerm
    - Stop udisks-daemon on remove. (Closes: #590013)
  * debian/control
    - Bump Standards-Version to 3.9.1. No further changes.
    - Update Build-Depends according to configure.ac.

udisks (1.0.1+git20100614-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Upgrade to current git HEAD:
    - Update to latest LVM2 API (currently not used in Debian)
    - Fix long hangs on probing nonexistant floppy drives. (LP: #539515)
    - Do not have files executable on NTFS.
    - Some test suite updates.
  * Remove debian/patches/00git-*.
  * Drop transitional devicekit-disks-doc package. It's been in testing long
    enough, and we do not want to carry it into the squeeze release.
  * debian/control: Have udisks Conflicts:/Replaces: devicekit-disks, to
    properly clean up. (Closes: #585169)
  * 02-defer_smart_probing.patch, 10-ide-cd-support.patch: Refresh to apply
    cleanly.
  * Switch to "3.0 (quilt)" format. Drop quilt build dependency.
  * 08-dont-probe-dm-devices.patch: Update for udisks and to current code, but
    still keep it disabled. Proper handling of linear DMs and DMMP devices
    (which are disabled right now, though) still require finding out the
    parent devices through UDISKS_DM_TARGETS_{PARAMS,TYPE} and there is
    currently no equivalent from the dmsetup rules.

 -- Martin Pitt <mpitt@debian.org>  Mon, 14 Jun 2010 16:11:35 +0200

udisks (1.0.1-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add 00git-vfat-showexec.patch: Enable the "showexec" vfat mount option, to
    avoid data files being executable (which causes confusing question dialogs
    in nautilus which only have one sensible answer). Patch taken from
    upstream git head. (LP: #14335)
  * Add 00git-dont-probe-nondata-cdroms.patch: Don't probe non-data CD-ROMs
    for partition tables. Patch taken from upstream git head.

    - Clean up stale mounts from devices in /etc/fstab, too. (LP: #476654)
    - Fix recognition of unpartitioned VFAT drives, which were previously
      misdetected as MBR. (LP: #536670)
    - Use lseek64() instead of lseek() in job-drive-benchmark.c, to also work
      with large devices. (LP: #526524)
  * Refresh patches.
  * debian/rules
    - Disable lvm2 and dmmp (device-mapper multipath) support.
  * debian/patches/11-remove-unused-probers.patch
    - As we build without lvm2 support, remove the udisks-lvm-pv-export call
      from 80-udisks.rules to avoid unnecessary checks if the binary exists.
    - Remove the blkid call for device-mapper devices as dmsetup already does
      the probing for us.

    - Update detach helper for current sysfs interface
    - Add a --disable-remote-access option
    - Fix missing DKD_ property renames in 80-udisks.rules
  * Add 02-defer_smart_probing.patch: The initial ATA SMART probing in
    device_new() is very expensive (takes about 0.5 s of CPU/IO time on a Dell
    Mini 10). Defer the check by half a minute, so that we don't block CPU/IO
    when we need it much more urgently (on desktop session startup or when

  [ Michael Biebl ]
  * debian/patches/09-reiserfs-support.patch
    - Add support for ReiserFS.

  [ Martin Pitt ]
  * Add debian/local/ubuntu.pkla: Allow passwordless file system operations

    debian/rules. (LP: #465054)
  * Add 02-allow-simulated-smart.patch: Allow simulated SMART data on

  * debian/rules: Enable quilt patch system. Add quilt build dependency.
  * Add 01-mkfs-tempdir.patch: Daemon does not create /var/run/DeviceKit-disks/,

    from upstream git head. (LP: #428133)
  * Add 02-unlock-CD-trays-after-mounting.patch: Unlike in the hal world, we
    do not have a daemon polling CD drives for eject button presses. In order
    to make hardware tray eject buttons work, unlock the tray after
    mounting a CD. This is pretty much equivalent to yanking out USB sticks,

    default was changed in the Linux kernel for 2.6.32 as well.
    (https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=24129, LP: #428174)
  * Add 00git-crash-on-removing-NULL-value-from-hash.patch: Properly handle
    the situtation where we're processing a 'change' event but the 'remove'
    event has happened but is still queued up in our own process. Also handle
    device file renames and 'move' uevents.
    (http://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=24264, LP: #414407)
  * Add 06-show-MMC-MemStick-cards-by-default.patch: Show MMC/MemStick cards
    by default; the previous whitelist in the udev rules ignored them.
    (https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=24053, LP: #429752)
  * Add 05-german-translations.patch: Add German translations.

devicekit-disks (007-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release:
    - Drop usage of DeviceKit, talk directly to udev now.
    - Port to PolicyKit 1 API.
    - Lots of bug fixes.
  * debian/control:
    - libpolkit-dbus-dev â libpolkit-gobject-1-dev, libpolkit-backend-1-dev
      build dependency. (PolicyKit 1 API)
    - libdevkit-gobject-dev â libgudev-1.0-dev build dependency, drop
      devicekit dependency (death to DeviceKit).
    - Bump libatasmart-dev build dependency to >= 0.14 as required by
      upstream.
    - Bump libudev-dev build dependency to >= 0.142 as required by upstream.
    - Drop libsqlite3-dev build-dependency, not necessary any more.
    - Add libsgutils2-dev build dependency as required by upstream.
  * debian/devicekit-disks.install: 
    - Update path for new policykit-1 files.
    - Add new pkgconfig file.
    - Install usr/share/locale and usr/share/man.
  * debian/rules: Ignore usr/lib/polkit-1/ for dh_makeshlibs, they are backends
    for PolicyKit.
  * debian/rules: Explicitly enable gtk-doc, not done by default any more.
  * debian/control: Bump Standards-Version to 3.8.3 (no changes necessary).
  * Add debian/devicekit-disks.postinst: Kill the old devkit-disks-daemon on
    upgrade, to ensure that the new version will be used at the next occasion.
    (LP: #403192)
  * debian/control: Add Breaks to GDU libraries << 2.28, since the D-Bus API
    changed.
  * debian/*.install: Drop debian/tmp/ prefix, since we use dh compat 7.
    Also, simplify and sort the file lists.
  * Drop reduntant debian/devicekit-disks.manpages, already done in *.install.
  * debian/control: Add myself to Uploaders: with Michael's consent.
