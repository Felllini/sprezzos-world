  * Reduce debhelper dependency from 9 to 8, to allow the source to
    build in Debian Squeeze without any changes.
  * New patch 04-init-vectors.patch to make sure the lcVector2 and
    lcVector3 member variables always are initialized.
  * New patch 05-zipfile_signed.patch to get rid of some signed/unsigned
    warnings from the compiler.

    MIME types, according to the list at
    <URL: http://www.ldraw.org/reference/specs/mimetypes.shtml >.
  * New patch 10-fix_segfault.patch to avoid calling stat() with
    uninitialized memory and crashing with segfault.
  * Correct email address of upstream in copyright file to one
    that is working.
