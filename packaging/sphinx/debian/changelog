  * Improve dh_sphinxdoc:

sphinx (1.1.2+dfsg-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Don't run ‘python setup.py clean’ in the clean target (we nuke the whole
    build subdirectory anyway).
  * Move python-all and python-setuptools from Build-Depends to
    Build-Depends-Indep, as it's not needed in the clean target anymore.
  * Don't run dh_testroot in the clean target. There's a good chance that root
    privileges are not needed (e.g. because binary target was run under
    fakeroot), and even if they are actually needed, the target will fail
    quickly.
  * Run tests against Python 3:
    + Add build-dependency on python3-nose, python3-docutils,
      python3-pygments, python3-jinja2, python3-sqlalchemy.
    + Add python3_test_syspath.diff to fix Python 3 sys.path for the test
      runner.
    + Add python3_test_build_dir.diff to hardcode Python 3 build directory in
      the test runner to the one that the package uses.
    + Add test running code debian/rules. Don't use --no-skip for the moment,
      as some required packages don't exist yet (see #647441, #647439). Set
      LC_ALL=C.UTF-8 to work around failures under LC_ALL=C (see
      <http://deb.li/H8ED> and <http://deb.li/3Rw0z>).

 -- Jakub Wilk <jwilk@debian.org>  Tue, 14 Feb 2012 00:13:35 +0100

sphinx (1.1.2+dfsg-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Make the build actually fail if integration tests for the JavaScript
    code fail.
  * Don't remove *.egg-info in the clean target; add it to extend-diff-ignore
    instead.
  * Pass --no-guessing-deps to dh_python3.

 -- Jakub Wilk <jwilk@debian.org>  Sun, 05 Feb 2012 19:33:59 +0100

sphinx (1.1.2+dfsg-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Upload to unstable (closes: #655637).
  * Use xargs to iterate over all Python versions.
  * Make sphinx-autogen initialize the sphinx.ext.autodoc module (hopefully
    closes: #611078).

 -- Jakub Wilk <jwilk@debian.org>  Sun, 05 Feb 2012 17:59:55 +0100

sphinx (1.1.2+dfsg-2) experimental; urgency=low

  * Add sphinxcontrib_namespace.diff: create namespace package
    ‘sphinxcontrib’. This allows python-sphinxcontrib.* packages, both those
    using dh_python2 and those using python-support, to be co-importable.
  * Add various texlive-* and libjs-mathjax to Suggests.
  * Don't install SOURCES.txt into binary packages.
  * dh_sphinxdoc: produce different diagnostic message when unknown JavaScript
    script is being ignored than when it's a fatal error. Thanks to Sandro
    Tosi for the bug report.
  * Make the get-orig-source script create temporary files in /tmp (or
    $TMPDIR).
  * Revert all the changes to manual pages that accumulated over the years.
  * Document that symlinking translations.js and non-English searchtools.js is
    not supported (see bug #658238).
  * Don't include websupport.js in libjs-jquery. Make dh_sphinxdoc remove this
    file from binary package.
  * dh_sphinxdoc: -X<item> should now exclude a file if <item> exists anywhere
    in the path, so it can be used e.g. to exclude whole directories.
  * Fix a typo in dh_sphinxdoc manual page.

 -- Jakub Wilk <jwilk@debian.org>  Fri, 03 Feb 2012 13:52:49 +0100

sphinx (1.1.2+dfsg-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream release (closes: #649048).
    + Drop autosummary_1.0.6.patch for the time being (reopens: #611078).
    + Drop docstring_parse.diff, applied upstream.
    + Rename disable_ez_setup.diff to disable_distribute_setup.diff.
    + Drop move_static_files_outside_site-packages.patch. Most of it was
      applied upstream, the remaining bits are now taken care of in
      debian/rules.
    + Refresh other patches.
    + Update integration tests for the JavaScript code.
    + Bump minimum required versions:
      - python-docutils to >= 0.7;
      - python-pygments to >= 1.2;
      - python-jinja2 to >= 2.3.
      - python to >= 2.5.
    + Add code to install also JavaScript files that are generated at build
      time. Add websupport.js to dh_sphinxdoc index.
    + Update debian/copyright.
  * Texinfo output format is now supported (closes: #586747).
  * Update version numbers in the manual pages. Add a build-time warning to be
    emitted if they ever get out of date again.
  * Build manual pages (except for sphinx-autogen.1) from reStructuredText
    sources.
  * Rephrase short package description, so that it's... shorter.
  * New binary package: sphinx-common, containing manual pages, templates,
    translations and other data files.
  * New binary package: sphinx-doc, containing documentation.
    + Conflict with previous versions python-sphinx.
    + /usr/share/doc/python-sphinx/html used to be a directory, but is now a
      symlink. Conflict with older versions of python-docutils, so that dpkg
      can replace one with the other. Add lintian override.
  * New binary package: python3-sphinx.
    + Both python-sphinx and python3-sphinx provide sphinx-* scripts. The
      scripts have:
      #!/usr/bin/python3 shebang if only python3-sphinx is installed;
      #!/usr/bin/python shebang otherwise.
    + /usr/bin/sphinx-* are now symlinks and are managed by docutils-common
      postinst/postrm maintainer scripts.
    + Make sphinx-common conflict with older versions of python-sphinx that
      were shipping /usr/bin/sphinx-* scripts. Add lintian override for
      conflicts-with-version.
    + Add build-dependency on python3 (needed for dh_python3) and
      python3-setuptools.
    + Add X-Python3-Version field.
  * Improve debian/rules:
    + Run dh_install with --fail-missing.
    + Refactor the code responsible for moving data into a private directory.
      Rename some variables to make them lowercase. Don't use CURDIR where
      it's not necessary.
    + Make it possible to rebuild the package without running clean target.
    + Remove unneeded mkdir calls.
    + Use a for loop in debian/rules to install all sphinx-* scripts.
    + Run nosetests with --verbose --no-skip.
  * Add build-dependency on the following packages (needed for the test
    suite): python-sqlalchemy, python-whoosh, python-xapian.
  * Use XS-Python-Version instead of debian/pyversions.

    + Remove them from debian/copyright.
    + Add build-dependency on libjs-underscore,
    + Update watch file to deal with the +dfsg suffix.
  * Unify multiple calls to dh_link.

      libjs-underscore.

sphinx (1.0.7-5) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Jakub Wilk ]
  * Bump standards version to 3.9.2 (no changes needed).
  * Bump minimum required version of jQuery to 1.4.
  * Use python (>= 2.6.6-14~) as an alternative build-dependency to
