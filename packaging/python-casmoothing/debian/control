Description: Context-aware mesh smoothing for biomedical applications
 Smoothing algorithms allow to reduce artifacts from mesh generation, but often
 degrade accuracy. The method described in the paper "Context-aware mesh
 smoothing for biomedical applications" identifies staircase artifacts which
 result from image inhomogeneities and binary segmentation in medical image
 data for subsequent removal by adaptive mesh smoothing. Thus, context-aware
 smoothing enables to adaptively smooth artifact areas, while non-artifact
 features can be preserved. This is a implementation of this method in Cpp
 with Python bindings.
