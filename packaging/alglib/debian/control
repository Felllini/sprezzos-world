    * Solvers (linear and nonlinear)
    * Interpolation
    * Optimization
    * Fast Fourier transforms
    * Numerical integration
    * Linear and nonlinear least-squares fitting
    * Ordinary differential equations
    * Special functions
    * Statistics (descriptive statistics, hypothesis testing)
    * Data analysis (classification/regression, including neural networks)
 .
 This package contains the development files (headers and documentation) for
 ALGLIB.
