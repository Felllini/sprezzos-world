# in an Ecere application to acknowledge in the application interface itself
# software used by or integrated with the Ecere SDK, and thus the resulting
# application itself. It can be found in: extras/gui/LicensesDialog.ec
# The licenses for those software components are thus provided as a convenience
# for use together with that dialog in: extras/res/licenses/
