Description: television display application
 This package provides a high quality television application for use with
 video capture cards. It processes the input from a capture card and
 displays it on a computer monitor or projector. Tvtime focuses on high
 visual quality, making it ideal for videophiles.
 .
 Main features:
  * deinterlaced output at a full interlaced rate of 59.94 frames per
    second for NTSC sources, or 50 frames per second for PAL sources.
    This gives smoothness of motion and high visual quality;
  * multiple deinterlacing algorithms for finding the optimal mode for
    the video content and available processor speed;
  * 16:9 aspect ratio mode for the highest available resolution when
    processing input from an external DVD player or digital satellite
    receiver;
  * super-slick on-screen-display for the complete television
    experience, with a featureful menu system;
  * "2:3 pulldown" detection for optimal quality viewing of film content
    from NTSC sources.
