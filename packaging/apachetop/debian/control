Description: Realtime Apache monitoring tool
 Apache top is a curses-based realtime utility to display information from a
 running copy of Apache.
 .
 It is modelled after the standard 'top' utility, and displays information such
 as the requests pers second, bytes per second and the most popular URLs
 displayed.
 .
 It must be run from a machine running Apache, as it works by processing the
 logfiles found in /var/log/apache.
