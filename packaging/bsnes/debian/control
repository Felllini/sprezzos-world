Description: Accurate SNES/SuperFamicom emulator
 bsnes is an emulator that focuses on accuracy, debugging functionality, and
 clean code. bsnes does not include speed and game-specific hacks for
 compatibility, and as a result the minimum system requirements are very high.
 .
 There are three profiles that differ in the amount of accuracy and required
 system resources. Which profile to use can be set with:
 .
 # update-alternatives --config bsnes-bin
 .
 Although not as polished as the SNES emulation (yet), there is also support
 for NES, Gameboy, Gameboy Color and Gameboy Advance games.
 .
 This package also contains bsnes-purify, a command line tool for preparing
 ROMs for usage with bsnes.
