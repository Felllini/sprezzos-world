Description: Remove -march=native build flag.
 * This will cause gcc to use all instruction subsets
   available on the build machine, meaning that the program
   will not work on computers where they are not available.
 * Also the flag is not supported on many architectures
   (armhf, s390, s390x, powerpc, ia64, ...).
