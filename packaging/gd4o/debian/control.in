Package: libgd-gd2-noxpm-ocaml
Architecture: any

Provides: ${ocaml:Provides}
Description: OCaml interface to the GD library -- runtime files
 This package provides an interface to the GD library for
 OCaml programmers.
 .
 GD is a graphics library. It allows your code to quickly draw images
 complete with lines, arcs, text, multiple colours, cut and paste from
 other images, flood fills, and write out the result as a PNG file.
 This is particularly useful in World Wide Web applications, where PNG is
 one of the formats accepted for inline images by most browsers.
 .
 This is the full development version of the library, built without XPM
 (X pixmap) or fontconfig support.
 .
 This package contains only the shared runtime stub libraries.
