lastfm (1:1.0.9.6~msk3) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * Changed patches:
    - 10_tray: slightly modify behavior to make it more intuitive (for me).
    - 13_alsa: Get rid of some unused variables.
    - 14_timebar: Trim to include only the necessary bits.
  * Removed patches:
    - 16_sensiblebrowser: Not needed for Linux client.  1.0.9.6 lets Qt figure
      it out for itself, but see below.
  * New patches:
    - 16_select-browser: Some people want to select which browser they use,
      and apparently Qt's default isn't acceptable.  Add an option in
      Tools->Options->Connection to manually configure the browser that the
      client uses.  It will default to "sensible-browser."
    - 19_delete-http: The webservice plugin doesn't delete http requests,
      which causes lastfm to use up more and more memory at each song change.
      (This seems to average about 200-300k per song, according to top.)  One
      delete was commented out (why?) and another was missing.  Add/enable
      them.
    - 20_noupdates: Downloading binary updates and plugins is a bad idea in a
      packaged situation.  This aggressively removes any code that checks for
      new versions, that downloads updates and plugins, or that configures
      media devices or players.  None of it relates to the linux client, and
      removing it shrinks the app by about 150K.

  * Change 13_alsa: now it's a whole new ALSA plugin that
    builds libplayback_alsa.so instead of libplayback_rtaudio.so.
    Advantages:
    - Adds default device support for those who need dmix.
    - Full device names appear in the soundcard combobox
    - No need to restart app after changing devices: just stop and
      play again.
    - Easier to debug. :)
  * Add 18_valgrind: fix a few memory leaks that valgrind reported.

lastfm (1:1.0.9.6~msk1) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * New upstream.
  * New patches:
    - 02_noitunes: Linux doesn't have iTunes, so don't build things that we
      will never use.
  * Update older patches to account for source changes:
    - 00_build: no need to patch definitions.pro.inc, but we do need to fix
      some misbehaving makefiles (see #345388).
    - 11_history: remove friendly history names; implemented upstream.
    - 17_draglabel: no more CPU load problem, so remove.  But do show all
      words in multi-word labels.
    - Other minor tweaks to patches so they apply cleanly.
