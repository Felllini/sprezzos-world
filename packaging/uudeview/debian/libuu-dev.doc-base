Title: The UUDeview Decoding Library
Author: Frank Pilhofer
Abstract: The UUDeview library is a highly portable set of functions that
 provide facilities for decoding uuencoded, xxencoded, Base64 and
 BinHex-Encoded files as well as for encoding binary files into all of
 these representations except BinHex. This document describes how the
 features of encoding and decoding can be integrated into your own
 applications.
