+.TH "SKYMON" "1" "February 12, 2007" "Dario Minnucci <midget@debian.org>" ""
+.SH "NAME"
+skymon \- "moncmd" interface to a SkyTel 2\-way pager
+.SH "DESCRIPTION"
+.PP 
+.\" TeX users may be more comfortable with the \fB<whatever>\fP and
+.\" \fI<whatever>\fP escape sequences to invode bold face and italics, 
+.\" respectively.
+\fBskymon\fP 
+This is a "moncmd" interface to a SkyTel 2\-way pager.
+.PP 
+It utilizes procmail filters and password authentication to do its trick.
+I would not call this a "secure" authentication mechanism, but in Marcus Ranum\-speak it is "really nice". Use at your own risk.
+.PP 
+It would be even more "really nice" if this did SecureID or S/Key.
+.PP 
+Also keep in mind that all queries and all results pass through the Great Wide Internet to get back to your pager.
+
+.SH "OPERATION"
+Commands are sent via email with the following format:
+
+/password:command
+
+Commands are the following, and can only be used if they exist in the
+"allow" file:
+
+.TP 
+.B eh
+Enable host
+.TP 
+.B es
+Enable service
+.TP 
+.B ew
+Enable watch
+.TP 
+.B dh host reason
+Disable host
+.TP 
+.B ds watch service reason
+Disable service
+.TP 
+.B dw watch reason
+Disable watch
+.TP 
+.B lf
+List failures
+.TP 
+.B ld
+List disabled
+
+.PP 
+The idea behind the brevity is that it's a pain to compose messages
+on that silly little keypad.
