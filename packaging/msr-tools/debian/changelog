msr-tools (1.2-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Don't allow the package to install anything into /usr/sbin
    (closes: #552958, #554583).
  * Bump the versioned build-dep on debhelper accordingly, as
    override_dh_auto_install is necessary.

msr-tools (1.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release (for some value of "new").
  * Bump standards version.
  * Switch from cdbs to debhelper.  It was being too clever in overriding
    our CFLAGS, which resulted in 64bit stuff breaking (closes: #495445).
  * Update copyright info w/ hpa's mark.
  * Drop 001-pwrite_warnings.patch, as it turns out that it was only
    necessary due to the aforementioned CFLAGS clobberage.
