at-spi2-atk (2.4.0-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Rename libatk-adaptor-schemas to libatk-adaptor-data, and move message
  translations to it (closes: Bug#669986).
  * Make it not multi-arch:foreign, to make sure we do not install the
  non-native version, which would break use of the schema for native
  applications (while unbreaking for non-native ones). Make libatk-adaptor
  recommend it, not depend on it, so that it does not have to be foreign.

    version for safety.
